# The John Story

## Why 80% of Businesses Lose Without Knowing It
## **It's 11:56 AM. John's Boss Just Dropped a Problem on His Desk.**
**The Scenario:** John needs a contractor. Fast. He's got 4 minutes until lunch to find someone who can handle an urgent job.
**What John Does:**
1. Opens Google Maps
2. Finds 5 businesses that could help
3. Checks each business's social media profiles
4. **Eliminates 3 immediately** - no recent posts, generic content, looks inactive
5. Calls only the 2 who look "alive" and attentive
**The Result:** 3 businesses never even know John existed.

## **This Happens 5-10 Times Per Month in Your Market**
**The Johns are everywhere:**
*   Property managers with emergency repairs
*   Business owners with urgent deadlines
*   Homeowners with weekend projects
*   Anyone who needs you "right now"
**They all use the same elimination process:**
*   Quick social media check = trust test
*   Recent activity = "they're paying attention"
*   Dead profiles = "they might be out of business"

* * *

## **The Browser Tab Test**
**Picture John's screen:** 5 browser tabs open. Your business is in Tab 3.
**Tab 1:** Last post 3 months ago → ELIMINATED **Tab 2:** Generic stock photos → ELIMINATED
**Tab 3:** Your business - what does John see? **Tab 4:** Fresh work photos from yesterday → SURVIVES **Tab 5:** Professional content, active responses → SURVIVES
**Only 2 tabs get phone calls. Which one are you?**

## **Why Most Businesses Fail This Test**
**The Hidden Truth:** You're not competing on price or quality during the 4-minute decision. You're competing on who looks more **present** and **attentive**.
**Common Failures:**
*   Last post was 6 weeks ago
*   Stock photos that look generic
*   No evidence of recent work
*   Social profiles look abandoned
**The John Test Question:**_"If I hire them and something goes wrong, will they be responsive?"_
