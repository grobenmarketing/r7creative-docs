## HOW WE'RE DIFFERENT

**Headline:** We Don't Manage Social Media. We Manage Your Digital Pulse.

**Subheadline:** A completely different approach to local business visibility

| **Traditional Agencies** | **R7 Creative — You Capture, We Create** |
|---|---|
| Create all content without your input | Collaborative—you provide authentic moments |
| Focus on followers, likes, vanity metrics | Focus on phone calls, quotes, revenue |
| Long contracts, expensive retainers | Affordable monthly investment, no contracts, 30-day trial |
| Generic content lacking authenticity | Your real work becomes compelling content |
| Costs increase over time | Costs stay predictable, results improve |
| Measure success by content metrics | Measure success by business results |

**The Real Difference:**
We don't "do marketing for you." We ensure you pass the 4-minute decision test when prospects are evaluating your business. You do 10-15%. We handle 85-90%. That's it.
