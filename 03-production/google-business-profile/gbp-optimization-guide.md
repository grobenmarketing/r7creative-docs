## 📝 Comprehensive Google Business Profile (GBP) Optimization Guide

This guide outlines the official requirements, ranking factors, and ongoing management tasks necessary for a complete and highly visible Google Business Profile.

### I. 🌐 Website and Online Alignment

Your website is a critical ranking factor and must be consistent with your GBP[cite: 27, 56].

* **Organic SEO Influence:** Your website's traditional SEO practices and position in organic web results factor into local ranking[cite: 27].
* **Consistency is Key:** Your GBP must use your **actual real-world business name** as it appears on your website, stationery, and storefront signage[cite: 56].
* **Prominence Factor:** Prominence draws from information across the web, including links and articles, making your website a core component of your overall reputation[cite: 26].

### II. 🔎 Google's Three Core Local Ranking Factors

Google determines all local visibility using the following factors in combination[cite: 12, 13]:

| Factor | Definition | Actions to Control |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Relevance** | How well your profile matches the search query[cite: 16]. | Complete and accurate information[cite: 17]. Use specific categories that define what the business *is*[cite: 19]. |
| **Distance** | Proximity between the business and the location term or the searcher's location[cite: 21]. | Ensure your address is accurate[cite: 22]. Properly configure service areas (max. $\approx$ two hours driving time)[cite: 23]. |
| **Prominence** | How well-known your business is, both online and offline[cite: 24]. | Accumulate more reviews and positive ratings[cite: 25]. Strong traditional website SEO and web links/articles[cite: 26, 27]. |

### III. ✅ Initial Setup Requirements (The Foundation)

These are the critical one-time setup tasks and policy compliance requirements:

#### A. Policy & Verification
* **Verification:** This is mandatory for full feature access and makes your profile "more likely to show up in search results"[cite: 71, 5].
* **Business Name Compliance:** Must exactly match your real-world name on signage/websites[cite: 56]. **Do not** include marketing taglines, keywords, or unnecessary special characters; this can result in suspension[cite: 57, 58, 135].
* **Location:** Use a precise, accurate address (P.O. boxes are not acceptable)[cite: 74]. Service-area businesses must hide their address if they don't serve customers at that location[cite: 75].

#### B. Profile Details
* **Categories:** Select the most **specific** primary category, using as few categories as possible[cite: 59, 60].
* **Business Description:** Provide honest, useful information on services, mission, and history[cite: 63]. **Prohibited:** Special promotions, prices, or links[cite: 64].
* **Attributes:** Add identity (e.g., Women-owned) and accessibility attributes to help your business appear in relevant searches[cite: 78, 79].

#### C. Photos
Businesses with photos are more likely to receive direction requests and website clicks[cite: 47].
* **Technical Specs:** JPG or PNG, 10 KB–5 MB, recommended $720\text{ px} \times 720\text{ px}$[cite: 66].
* **Minimum Initial Quantities:** Three exterior, three interior, three product (or service/food/drink), and three team photos[cite: 48, 68, 69].

#### D. Products & Services
* **Products (Retailers):** In-store products can show in search results and on your profile, increasing visibility[cite: 85].
* **Services (Service Businesses):** Adding specific services with descriptions and prices helps them get highlighted on your profile when searched[cite: 91].

### IV. 🔄 Ongoing Management (Required for Maintenance)

The algorithm rewards profiles that demonstrate consistent management and active ownership[cite: 129].

| Activity | Recommendation / Policy | Visibility Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Review Management** | Respond to customer reviews in a **timely manner**[cite: 35]. This shows you value their feedback[cite: 34]. | Directly influences the **Prominence** ranking factor[cite: 116]. |
| **Information Updates** | **Regularly update** hours, special hours for holidays, and other information[cite: 37, 112]. | Essential for maintaining **Relevance**; inaccurate info can prevent you from showing up[cite: 39]. |
| **Google Posts** | Post at least **biannually**[cite: 42]. Posts older than six months are archived[cite: 120]. | Helps customers **decide to visit your business** (Conversion benefit)[cite: 43]. |
| **Photo Updates** | Update as needed (seasonal, new products) to keep the profile current and engaging[cite: 124]. | Fresh imagery generates a "more likely to receive requests for driving directions and clicks"[cite: 123]. |
| **Q&A Monitoring** | Monitor and provide authoritative answers to customer questions[cite: 51]. | Demonstrates profile activity and customer engagement[cite: 52]. |
| **Manage Automated Updates** | Regularly review and manage suggested updates Google makes based on user reports or licensed content[cite: 125]. | Prevents inaccurate information from appearing, which undermines the core requirement of accuracy[cite: 126]. |
| **Profile Access** | **Consistent activity** is required; inactivity may result in access revocation and content removal[cite: 110]. | Signals active ownership, which the algorithm rewards[cite: 129]. |
