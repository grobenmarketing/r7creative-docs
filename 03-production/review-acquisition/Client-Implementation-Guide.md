## Part 1: Understanding Why This Works

### Google's Review Algorithm (2 Minutes Read)

Google rewards businesses that have:

✅ **Fresh Reviews** - Consistent, recent reviews (weekly is ideal)
✅ **User-Generated Media** - Photos and videos in reviews
✅ **Engaged Responses** - Business owner replies personally
✅ **Review Variety** - Diverse content, not cookie-cutter responses

### The One Critical Insight

**Reviews are earned IN-PERSON, IN THE MOMENT—not requested later.**

When you ask for a review via email or text later:
- 95% of people forget or don't follow through
- It requires multiple follow-ups
- It feels impersonal

When you ask for a review in-person, right now:
- 70-80% of satisfied customers complete it immediately
- No follow-up needed
- Creates a personal connection
- Social accountability ensures completion

**This difference is everything.**

---

## Part 2: Setting Up Your Review Tools (30 Minutes)

### Tool #1: Create Your Google Review Link

**Step 1**: Find your Google Business Profile Place ID
1. Go to Google Maps
2. Search for your business
3. Click "Share" → Copy link
4. Your Place ID is in the URL

**Step 2**: Create your direct review link
```
https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=YOUR_PLACE_ID
```

**Step 3**: Test it
- Open the link in your browser
- It should take you directly to the review form for your business

---

### Tool #2: Create Your QR Code

**Option A**: Use a Free QR Code Generator
1. Go to qr-code-generator.com (or any free QR generator)
2. Paste your Google review link
3. Download the QR code as PNG
4. Save it to your phone and computer

**Option B**: Use a Short URL First (Recommended)
1. Go to bit.ly or tinyurl.com
2. Create a short link (e.g., bit.ly/review-acme-roofing)
3. Use this short link to create your QR code
4. **Benefit**: You can update the destination later if needed

---

### Tool #3: Deploy Your QR Code

**For Field Teams**:
- Save QR code image to phone (easy to show customers)
- Print on business cards (leave-behind option)
- Print on service paperwork/invoices
- Create laminated cards for crews to carry

**For In-Store/Office**:
- Print 8.5x11 poster for counter
- Create table tents
- Add to receipts

**Pro Tip**: Have the QR code in 2 places:
1. **Primary**: On your phone (show them immediately)
2. **Backup**: On a physical card (if they want to do it later)

---

### Tool #4: Pre-Prepared Photos/Videos

Create a folder on your phone with recent project photos:
- Before/after shots
- Completed installations
- Happy customers (with permission)
- Service team in action

**Why?**: When customers don't have a photo to add, you can text them one they can use.

---

## Part 3: The In-Person Ask Process

This is your secret weapon. Master this conversation and everything else falls into place.

### The Complete Conversation Script

---

#### STEP 1: Check Satisfaction

**You Say**:
"Hey, how was our service today?"
*OR*
"Are you happy with how everything turned out?"

**Wait for Response**:
- ✅ **If POSITIVE** → Continue to Step 2
- ❌ **If NEGATIVE** → Solve the problem first, don't ask for review

---

#### STEP 2: Set the Context

**You Say**:
"That's great to hear! You know, the final part of our service process is to ask you to review us on Google."

**Wait for Acknowledgment**:
- Usually they'll say "okay" or nod
- This primes them for the next step

---

#### STEP 3: Make the Personal Ask

**You Say**:
"The best thing that would really help me [and our team] is if we could do that right now. I know life gets busy and it's so easy to forget. Would you mind taking out your phone?"

**Key Phrases**:
- "Would really help me" (personal connection)
- "Right now" (creates urgency)
- "Life gets busy" (acknowledges their reality)
- "Taking out your phone" (specific action request)

**Most Common Response**:
"Sure, I can do that."

---

#### STEP 4: Deploy the QR Code

**You Say**:
"Perfect! Just scan this code and it'll take you right to our review page."

**Your Action**:
- Pull up QR code on your phone
- Hold it steady for them to scan
- Give them 5 seconds

**If They Need Help**:
- "Sometimes you need to sign into your Google account first—do you need any help with that?"
- Walk them through if needed (it's usually just a few taps)

---

#### STEP 5: Guide the Content

**When They Ask "What Should I Write?"**:

**You Say**:
"Just share your honest experience—maybe mention something specific about [the service/installation/product]. And if you could include my name, that would be really helpful for me personally."

**Specific Examples**:
- "Maybe mention how the crew kept everything clean"
- "You could talk about how quickly we got you scheduled"
- "Whatever stood out to you about the experience"

**Why This Works**:
- Gives them a starting point
- Ensures review variety (different specific details)
- Gets your name in the review (for your personal recognition)

---

#### STEP 6: Request Media Enhancement

**After They Start Typing**:

**You Say**:
"Before you send that, would it be too much trouble to add a quick photo or video? Those really help other customers see the quality of work."

**Scenario A - They Don't Have One**:

**You Say**:
"No problem! Let me text you a couple photos we took of [the installation/work], and you can just attach one if you want."

- Text them 2-3 photos from your pre-prepared folder
- They can select and attach in seconds
- Don't push if they decline

**Scenario B - They Can Take One**:

Some customers will say "Oh, let me just take a quick picture!" and use their phone camera right there. Great!

**Scenario C - They Decline**:

That's okay! Not every review needs media. Making it a habit to ask will get you media in 30-40% of reviews, which is excellent.

---

#### STEP 7: The Release (Critical)

**You Say**:
"I really appreciate you doing this. I don't want to look over your shoulder, so tap whatever star rating you feel we deserve. I just ask that you hit 'send' before we wrap up here, if that's okay."

**Why This Step Matters**:
- Gives them psychological permission for authentic feedback
- Removes pressure (they don't feel watched)
- Maintains the "complete it now" momentum
- Shows confidence in your service

**Wait Nearby**:
- Step back a bit
- Give them space
- Wait for the "submitted" confirmation

---

#### STEP 8: Thank Them

**When They Hit Submit**:

**You Say**:
"Thank you so much! This really does make a difference for our business. I appreciate you taking the time."

**Your Action**:
- Genuine smile and thank you
- This is the last impression—make it warm

---

### What If They Say "I'll Do It Later"?

**You Say**:
"I totally understand! Here's a card with the QR code on it so you have it handy. I really appreciate it."

**Your Action**:
- Hand them a business card with QR code
- Don't push harder (respecting boundaries is important)

**Reality Check**:
- Maybe 10% of "I'll do it later" actually complete
- That's okay—you'll get plenty from the in-person completions

---

## Part 4: Training Your Team

Your review acquisition results are only as good as your team's execution. Here's how to train them effectively.

### Initial Training Session (1 Hour)

#### Agenda:

**1. The Why (10 minutes)**
- Show them your current review count vs competitors
- Explain Google's algorithm and why reviews matter
- Share the business impact (more customers = job security)

**2. The Leaderboard (5 minutes)**
- Show your competitive tracking spreadsheet
- "Here's where we are vs. our top 5 competitors"
- "Our goal is to become the most reviewed in our category"

**3. The Process Walkthrough (15 minutes)**
- Read through the 8-step conversation script
- Answer questions
- Address concerns about "feeling pushy"

**4. Role-Playing Practice (25 minutes)**
- Pair up team members
- One plays customer, one plays service rep
- Run through the full conversation 2-3 times each
- Switch roles
- You demonstrate first with someone

**5. Tool Tutorial (5 minutes)**
- Show them the QR code on their phone
- Demonstrate scanning process
- Show where the photos folder is

---

### Addressing Team Objections

**Objection**: "It feels pushy to ask for a review."

**Response**: "I felt that way too at first. But here's the thing—if we did great work, we're not being pushy. We're giving them an easy way to help a business they like. Most people want to help; they just forget or don't know how. We're making it easy."

---

**Objection**: "What if they say no?"

**Response**: "Then you say 'No problem at all!' and hand them a card with the QR code. Not everyone will say yes, and that's totally okay. We're looking for the people who want to help, not forcing anyone."

---

**Objection**: "What if they give us a bad review?"

**Response**: "If someone's unhappy, we need to know that BEFORE we ask for a review. That's why step 1 is 'How was our service?' If there's a problem, we fix it first. And honestly, a few 4-star reviews mixed in with 5-stars actually makes us look more authentic."

---

### Role-Playing Scenarios to Practice

**Scenario 1: The Busy Customer**

**Customer**: "I'm really in a rush right now..."
**Rep**: "I totally understand—this will only take about 60 seconds. Can I pull it up on your phone while we walk to your car?"

---

**Scenario 2: The Tech-Challenged Customer**

**Customer**: "I'm not very good with technology..."
**Rep**: "No worries at all! I'll walk you through every step. First, scan this code... great! Now tap here... perfect! You're doing great."

---

**Scenario 3: The "I Don't Do Reviews" Customer**

**Customer**: "I don't really leave reviews..."
**Rep**: "I completely understand. This is actually the first review request for most of our customers too. It would really help me personally if you'd consider it—it only takes a minute and I'd be happy to guide you through it."

---

**Scenario 4: The "What Do I Write?" Customer**

**Customer**: "I never know what to say in these things..."
**Rep**: "Just share what stood out to you—maybe mention that we showed up on time, or that the crew was respectful, or anything specific you appreciated. There's no wrong answer!"

---

### Practice Makes Perfect

**Key Point**: The discomfort goes away with practice. After your team does this 5-10 times, it becomes natural.

**Ongoing Practice**:
- Monthly role-playing in team meetings
- Share success stories ("John got 3 reviews this week!")
- Celebrate good examples when reviews come in

---

## Part 5: Building Your Review Culture

Sustainable results require building reviews into your company culture.

### Weekly Review Meeting (15 Minutes)

**Schedule**: Same day/time every week (Friday mornings work well)

**Agenda**:

1. **Read Reviews Aloud (5 min)**
   - Read 3-5 recent reviews to the team
   - Celebrate good ones
   - Discuss any constructive feedback
   - Recognize team members mentioned by name

2. **Update the Leaderboard (3 min)**
   - Show current standings vs. competitors
   - Highlight progress: "We got 8 reviews this week, Competitor A got 2"
   - Visualize the gap closing

3. **Share Individual Stats (3 min)**
   - Who got the most reviews this week?
   - Recognize everyone who got at least one
   - No shaming for zeros—just encourage

4. **Quick Process Reminder (2 min)**
   - "Remember to ask right after service completion"
   - "Don't forget to offer photos if they don't have one"
   - Address any questions

5. **Motivation (2 min)**
   - Remind them of the goal
   - Share impact: "We're now ranking #2 in our city for our service!"

---

### The Competitive Leaderboard

Create a simple spreadsheet (Google Sheets works great) to track your business vs. competitors.

**Template**:

| Company Name | Total Reviews | Avg Stars | Last Review Date | Reviews/Week |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| **YOUR COMPANY** | **427** | **4.8** | **3 days ago** | **~8** |
| Competitor A | 312 | 4.6 | 2 weeks ago | ~1 |
| Competitor B | 189 | 4.9 | 1 month ago | ~0.5 |
| Competitor C | 523 | 4.4 | 5 days ago | ~3 |
| Competitor D | 276 | 4.7 | 3 weeks ago | ~1 |

**How to Use It**:
1. Update weekly before your team meeting
2. Display it prominently in your office
3. Reference it in meetings: "We're only 96 reviews behind Competitor C!"
4. Celebrate milestones: "We just passed Competitor B!"

**What It Reveals**:
- Most competitors don't get weekly reviews
- You can see momentum shifts
- It gamifies the competition
- Creates team buy-in

---

### Team Incentives & Recognition

**Option 1: Monthly Competition**
- Most reviews in a month wins $100 gift card
- Creates friendly competition
- Resets monthly so everyone has a chance

**Option 2: Threshold Rewards**
- Every team member who gets 5+ reviews in a month gets recognized
- Small rewards (coffee gift card, extra PTO hour, team lunch)
- Focuses on participation, not just winning

**Option 3: Team Goal Bonuses**
- "If we get 100 reviews this quarter, we'll do a team outing"
- Builds collaboration instead of competition
- Everyone wins together

**What NOT to Do**:
- ❌ Don't penalize people for not getting reviews (creates resentment)
- ❌ Don't make incentives too large (looks like review buying)
- ❌ Don't only recognize the top performer (discourages others)

---

### Responding to Reviews (Critical!)

**The Rule**: Respond to EVERY review within 24-48 hours.

**Why It Matters**:
- Google values engagement
- Shows potential customers you care
- Boosts your ranking

**Response Template - Positive Review**:

```
Hi [Customer Name],

Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us this wonderful review! We're thrilled that [specific detail they mentioned] met your expectations. [Team member name] will be so happy to hear your kind words.

We appreciate your business and look forward to serving you again in the future!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Title]
```

**Response Template - Negative Review**:

```
Hi [Customer Name],

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I'm sorry that [specific issue] didn't meet your expectations. This isn't the experience we want for our customers.

I'd love to discuss this with you directly and see how we can make this right. Please contact me at [phone] or [email] at your convenience.

We appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to improve.

[Your Name]
[Your Title]
```

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Always be personal and specific
- ✅ Use the customer's name
- ✅ Reference specific details from their review
- ✅ Keep it professional but warm
- ❌ NEVER use AI-generated responses (Google can tell)
- ❌ Don't copy-paste the same response

---

## Part 6: Tracking Your Results

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**1. Total Review Count**

**3. Average Star Rating**
- Goal: Maintain 4.5+ stars
- Some 4-star reviews are actually good (shows authenticity)

**4. Media Percentage**
- Goal: 30-40% of reviews include photos/videos
- Track to ensure you're asking consistently

**5. Individual Team Member Stats**
- Reviews generated per team member
- Use for recognition, not punishment

**6. Competitive Position**

**Tab 3: Competitive Leaderboard**
(Use the template from Part 5)

---

### 30-Day Review Check

After 30 days of implementation, ask yourself:

✅ Are we getting at least 1 review per week?
✅ Are team members comfortable with the ask process?
✅ Are 25%+ of reviews including media?
✅ Are we responding to all reviews within 48 hours?
✅ Is the weekly meeting happening consistently?

**If YES to all**: You're on track! Keep going.

**If NO to any**: Review that specific section of this guide and reinforce with your team.

---

## Part 7: Quick Reference Guide

### The 8-Step In-Person Ask (Pocket Guide)

**Print this, laminate it, and give it to every team member:**

---

**1. CHECK SATISFACTION**
"How was our service today?"
→ If positive, continue. If negative, solve first.

**2. SET CONTEXT**
"The final part of our process is to ask you to review us on Google."

**3. MAKE THE ASK**
"The best thing that would help me is if we could do that right now. Would you mind taking out your phone?"

**4. DEPLOY QR CODE**
"Just scan this code—it'll take you right to our review page."

**5. GUIDE CONTENT**
"Share your honest experience and mention something specific. Including my name would help me personally."

**6. REQUEST MEDIA**
"Before you send that, would it be too much to add a quick photo?"
→ If they don't have one, text them photos.

**7. THE RELEASE**
"I don't want to look over your shoulder—tap whatever stars you feel we deserve. Just hit 'send' before we wrap up."

**8. THANK THEM**
"Thank you so much! This really makes a difference."

---

### Common Questions & Quick Answers

**Q: What if they ask "Why can't I just email you a review?"**
A: "Google reviews specifically help other customers find us online—email reviews stay private. Google is really the most helpful platform for us!"

**Q: What if they say "I already reviewed you years ago?"**
A: "That's awesome, thank you! You can actually update your review with your recent experience if you'd like, or we completely understand if you'd rather not."

**Q: What if they want to review us on Facebook/Yelp instead?**
A: "We appreciate that! Google is actually the most helpful for our business since that's where most people search, but any review you're comfortable with is great!"

**Q: What if a customer is genuinely unhappy but we can't fix it right away?**
A: "Don't ask for a review. Instead, say: 'I understand your frustration. Let me get [manager/owner] involved to see how we can resolve this. I'll follow up with you by [timeframe].'"

---

### Red Flags to Avoid

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Only ask happy customers (review gating - violates Google policy)
- ❌ Offer discounts/incentives for reviews (violates policy)
- ❌ Write reviews for customers (seriously, don't)
- ❌ Use family/friends to stuff reviews (Google will detect and penalize)
- ❌ Copy-paste the same review response (looks automated)
- ❌ Ask for positive reviews specifically (just ask for honest reviews)

**DO**:
- ✅ Ask all customers at appropriate moments
- ✅ Make it easy with QR codes and guidance
- ✅ Respond personally to all reviews
- ✅ Build it into company culture
- ✅ Track and celebrate progress

---
