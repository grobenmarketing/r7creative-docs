# The R7 Review Acquisition Framework

## Framework Definition

**The 6-Step GUIDED Framework for Acquiring 100+ High-Quality Google Reviews in 90 Days**

**GUIDED** stands for:
- **G**oogle Algorithm Understanding
- **U**ncover Review Opportunities
- **I**n-Person Ask Process
- **D**eployment Tools (QR Codes)
- **E**nhance with Media
- **D**evelop Review Culture

---

## The Proprietary System

This framework transforms service-based businesses from having a handful of reviews to hundreds or thousands of verified, high-quality Google reviews. The system was proven by taking a solar company from 6 reviews to nearly 1,900 reviews in approximately one year, making it the most reviewed company in its category in the state and second in the nation.

### Core Principle
**Reviews are earned in-person, in the moment, with guided completion—not requested later via automation.**

---

## The 6 Steps of the GUIDED Framework

### Step 1: **G**oogle Algorithm Understanding

Before implementing any review acquisition strategy, understand what Google values:

- **Fresh Reviews**: Google prioritizes businesses that receive consistent, recent reviews (weekly is ideal)
- **User-Supplied Media**: Reviews with photos or videos rank significantly higher
- **Business Responses**: Reviews that receive timely, human responses from the business owner improve rankings
- **Review Variety**: Diverse review content prevents the appearance of manipulation

**Key Insight**: A consistent flow of fresh, media-enhanced reviews with personal responses signals to Google that your business is active, engaged, and trustworthy.

---

### Step 2: **U**ncover Review Opportunities

Identify the optimal moments in your customer journey to request reviews. These moments vary by business type:

- **Contract Signing**: When commitment and excitement are highest
- **Service Performance/Installation**: During or immediately after service delivery
- **Post-Experience**: Days or weeks later, after the customer has experienced the results

**Critical Rule**: You need multiple review opportunities throughout the customer journey to maintain variety and authenticity. A single review touchpoint appears suspicious and limits volume.

**Strategy**: Map your customer journey and identify 2-4 natural moments where customers are most satisfied and available.

---

### Step 3: **I**n-Person Ask Process

This is the core of the framework. The absolute best way to get honest reviews is in-person, during face-to-face interactions.

#### The Conversation Flow:

1. **Check Satisfaction**:
   - "Hey, how was our service today?"
   - If response is positive → proceed
   - If response is negative → solve the problem BEFORE asking for a review

2. **Set the Context**:
   - "The final part of our process is to ask you to review us on Google."
   - Wait for acknowledgment

3. **Make the Personal Ask**:
   - "The best thing that would help me is [give specific reason]..."
   - "Would you mind taking out your phone and leaving that review right now?"

4. **Emphasize Timing**:
   - "I'd really appreciate if we could do this right now because life gets busy and people forget."
   - Make a compelling case for immediate action

**Critical Success Factor**: The in-person ask creates social accountability and significantly increases completion rates compared to follow-up emails or texts.

**Important Compliance Note**: Never gate reviews (only asking happy customers) or offer incentives for reviews. The in-person approach simply ensures reviews get completed when promised.

### Step 4: **D**eployment Tools (QR Codes)

Make the review process frictionless with proper tools:

#### Primary Tool: QR Code
- Have a QR code readily available on your phone or printed materials
- QR code links directly to your Google review page
- Customer scans → immediately arrives at review interface

#### Provide Hands-On Guidance:
- Some customers need help signing into their Google account
- Walk them through the process if needed
- Stay present during the process (but give appropriate space)

#### Fallback Option:
- Business cards with QR codes for customers who prefer to review later
- Accept that delayed reviews have lower completion rates

**Tech Tip**: You don't need expensive review software or automation platforms. A simple QR code generator and consistent execution outperform complex tools.

---

### Step 5: **E**nhance with Media

Reviews with photos or videos rank significantly higher in Google's algorithm.

#### The Media Request Process:

1. **Suggest Specific Content**:
   - After they start typing: "Before you send that, would it be difficult to add a photo or video?"
   - Provide specific suggestions related to the service (e.g., "a quick photo of the installation")

2. **Make It Easy**:
   - If the customer doesn't have a photo, you can text them pre-taken photos of the work
   - They can attach these to their review
   - Some customers will take a quick photo on the spot

3. **Read the Situation**:
   - Not every customer will add media—don't push too hard
   - Making it a habit to ask will significantly increase your media-enhanced review percentage

#### Review Content Guidance:

Guide customers to write specific, helpful reviews:
- Mention something specific about the service
- Include the service representative's name
- Keep it concise and authentic

**The "Release" Technique**: After helping with the technical aspects, say something like:
- "I don't want to look over your shoulder anymore—I want you to leave an honest review."
- "Tap whatever star rating you feel we deserve."
- This creates psychological permission for authentic feedback while maintaining the completion momentum

---

### Step 6: **D**evelop Review Culture

Sustainable review acquisition requires building a culture around reviews within your organization.

#### Weekly Review Meetings:

**What to Cover**:
- Read recent reviews aloud to the team
- Recognize who received reviews (this is why you ask customers to mention names)
- Discuss what's working and what needs improvement
- Role-play the ask process to build comfort and skill

**Meeting Frequency**: Weekly (at minimum)

#### Competitive Leaderboard:

Create a tracking spreadsheet with 3-5 competitors:

| Company Name | Total Reviews | Average Stars | Most Recent Review |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Your Company | [Track weekly] | [Monitor] | [Date] |
| Competitor 1 | | | |
| Competitor 2 | | | |
| Competitor 3 | | | |

**What This Reveals**:
- How many reviews competitors get per week (most won't have weekly reviews)
- How your volume and consistency compare
- Momentum shifts in the market

#### Team Engagement Strategies:

1. **Role-Playing**: Practice the ask process regularly to overcome discomfort
2. **Competitions**: Who can get the most reviews in a month
3. **Incentives**: Recognize and reward team members who consistently get reviews
4. **Transparency**: Share the numbers openly—what gets measured gets managed

**Cultural Shift**: Move from "asking for reviews is uncomfortable" to "reviews are part of excellent service delivery."

## Response Protocol: The Human Touch

When reviews come in, respond to them personally:

- **Never use AI** for review responses
- Keep responses human, personal, and specific to the review content
- Respond to ALL reviews (positive and negative)
- Google values engagement and recency of responses

**Response Frequency**: Ideally within 24-48 hours of the review being posted

---

## Expected Results

When implemented consistently:

- **Volume**: 100+ reviews in 90 days (with proper team size and customer flow)
- **Velocity**: Weekly fresh reviews (critical for Google rankings)
- **Quality**: Higher percentage of media-enhanced reviews
- **Rankings**: Significant improvement in local search rankings
- **Competitive Position**: Potential to become the most reviewed in your category/region

**Real-World Proof**: This framework took a solar company from 6 reviews to nearly 1,900 reviews in about one year, making it:
- The most reviewed company in its category in the state
- Second most reviewed in the nation in its category

## The Framework in Action: A Complete Example

**Context**: A roofing company completes an installation

**Representative**: "How does the new roof look? Are you happy with the work?"

**Customer**: "Yes, it looks great!"

**Representative**: "That's wonderful to hear! The final part of our process is to ask you to leave us a Google review. The best thing that would help me—and honestly our whole team—is if we could do that right now. Life gets busy, and I know how easy it is to forget. Would you mind taking out your phone?"

**Customer**: "Sure, I can do that."

**Representative**: *[Shows QR code on phone]* "Just scan this code and it'll take you right to our review page."

**Customer**: *[Scans code, opens review interface]*

**Representative**: "Sometimes people need to sign into their Google account first—do you need any help with that?"

**Customer**: "No, I'm good. What should I write?"

**Representative**: "Just share your honest experience—maybe mention something specific about the installation or the crew. And if you could include my name, that would be really helpful for me personally."

**Customer**: *[Types review]*

**Representative**: "This might seem like extra work, but would it be too difficult to add a quick photo of the new roof? Those really help other homeowners see the quality of work."

**Customer**: "Oh, I don't have one yet."

**Representative**: "No problem—let me text you a couple photos we took of the finished work, and you can just attach one if you want."

*[Texts photos, customer attaches one]*

**Representative**: "I really appreciate you doing this. I don't want to hover, so I'll step back—please leave whatever star rating you feel we deserve. I just ask that you hit send before we go, if that's okay."

**Customer**: *[Submits 5-star review with photo]*

**Representative**: "Thank you so much! This really does make a difference for our business."

## Why This Framework Works

1. **In-Person Accountability**: Social dynamics encourage completion
2. **Immediate Action**: No delay = no forgetting
3. **Guided Process**: Removes friction and confusion
4. **Media Enhancement**: Dramatically improves review ranking value
5. **Cultural Sustainability**: Built into company operations, not dependent on any individual
6. **No Technology Dependency**: Simple, low-cost, high-effectiveness approach
7. **Algorithm Alignment**: Designed specifically for what Google rewards

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Automation Dependency**: Automated emails/texts have dramatically lower completion rates
- **Delayed Asks**: "I'll email you a link" rarely converts
- **Lack of Cultural Support**: Without team buy-in and practice, execution falters
- **Inconsistent Execution**: Reviews must be weekly to maximize Google ranking impact
- **Fake Variety**: All reviews sounding the same raises red flags
- **Ignoring Responses**: Failing to respond to reviews wastes their ranking potential
- **Technology Over-Spending**: Expensive platforms don't replace in-person execution
