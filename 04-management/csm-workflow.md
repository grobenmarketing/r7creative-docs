# Customer Service Manager (CSM) Workflow

**STATUS:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ COMPLETE (Documented from ClickUp Implementation)

**Last Updated:** November 6, 2025

---

## Overview

This document outlines the complete Customer Service Manager workflow for R7 Creative, from client handoff through ongoing service management. This workflow is managed in ClickUp and ensures consistent, high-quality client onboarding and service delivery.

### The RaaS Philosophy: Results as a Service

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **We are a Results as a Service (RaaS) partner, not a software vendor.**
>
> Our clients hire us for a specific, measurable outcome. Our process—a marriage of cutting-edge software, automation, and expert humans-in-the-loop—is the engine that builds and delivers those results.
>
> **Your role as a CSM is to:**
> - **Drive Collaboration:** Proactively get client inputs (feedback, approvals, assets) needed to keep the engine running without friction
> - **Prove the Result:** Clearly and consistently demonstrate the tangible ROI our engine is producing
> - **Build Momentum:** Integrate our results stream into the client's operation, making us an indispensable part of their growth
>
> You are the client's primary human partner and the lead operator of their results engine.

### What This Document Covers

- Complete client onboarding process (contract to first content published)
- Brand strategy and content planning procedures
- Ongoing service management and bi-weekly sync calls
- Results-focused metrics and performance tracking
- Tools, templates, and procedures for each phase

### Core RaaS Metrics

> [!TIP]
> **Your performance is measured by the results we generate:**
>
> 1. **Time to First Result (TFR)** - Our #1 priority during onboarding
>    - **TFR #1 (Strategic Result):** Brand Pillars delivered within 2 days of Brand Strategy meeting
>    - **TFR #2 (Market-Facing Result):** First content published
>    - **Your Goal:** Be a "concierge" and remove any friction holding up these milestones
>
> 2. **Result Velocity Score (RVS)** - Your data-driven "pulse" on the account
>    - **Client Friction:** Is the client a collaborator or a bottleneck?
>    - **Engine Pace:** Is our internal process running smoothly?
>    - **Result Quality:** What was the outcome of the First Success Review?
>    - **Update After Every Bi-Weekly Sync**
>
> 3. **Client ROI (Return on Investment)** - The ultimate goal
>    - Defined at Discovery Call (defining the "R")
>    - Proven at First Success Review (showing the "I")
>    - Is the measurable return greater than their investment?

To officially introduce the service team, align on goals discussed during the sales process, and **create the Results Plan**.

---

### Task: 01 Discovery Call - [DATE]

**Type:** Passoff

**RaaS Play:** **Play 1 - The Handoff & Results Plan**

**Trigger:** Client has agreed to services and is being passed from sales to service team

---

#### Your Goal (RaaS Framework)

**Establish a true partnership and create the Results Plan.**

This is an alignment session to define "results." You are the human face of the engine. You must end this call with the answers to these questions, documented in a **"Results Plan"** (a ClickUp Doc):

**Critical Questions to Answer:**
1. *"What measurable result will make this partnership a 'home run' for you in 90 days?"*
2. *"What is the single most important metric you need our engine to move?"*

---

#### Meeting Objectives

- Introduce the service/implementation team
- Confirm goals and expectations from sales discussions

## Phase 2: Implementation & Onboarding

**RaaS Play:** **Play 2 - The Prescriptive Results Engine**

**Your Goal:** Get the client to Time to First Result (TFR) with zero friction.

**Your Role:** Be the Mission Controller. This checklist is our "launch sequence." It is not a list of their to-dos; it is a map of the collaboration required. You are the primary human-in-the-loop. Your job is to proactively manage this checklist.

**Celebrate the Outputs:** Send a "We've delivered!" email when Brand Pillars delivered (TFR #1) and First content published (TFR #2). This proves the engine is on.

This is the core setup phase, managed by the **Implementation Checklist** in ClickUp.
