# Google Business Profile

## Overview

The Google Business Profile (GBP) is the cornerstone of the "GBP-first" approach. This section focuses on complete optimization of the GBP listing based on Google's official recommendations and local search best practices.

5. **Customer Journey:** Most local searches start with Google Maps
