# Post-Capture Content Pipeline

## Overview

This document outlines the complete workflow from raw footage to published content, ensuring efficient editing, client approval, and seamless integration into the content calendar.

**Total Timeline:** 5-7 business days from capture to client review

---

## Phase 1: Backup & Organization (Same Day as Shoot)

### Immediate Backup (Within 4 Hours of Shoot)

**Critical First Step:**
- Copy all raw footage from camera cards to primary storage
- Create backup copy on external drive or cloud storage
- Verify file integrity (open random files to confirm no corruption)
- Do NOT format memory cards until backup is verified

**Why This Matters:**
- Footage is irreplaceable
- Memory card failure happens
- Client expects delivery - no reshoots

**Storage Structure:**
```
/Clients/[Client-Name]/Media-Capture-Sessions/
  /[Date]-Session-1/
    /RAW/
      /Video/
      /Photos/
    /EDITED/
      /Videos/
      /Photos/
    /DELIVERED/
    shot-list.pdf
    session-notes.txt
```

### Initial Organization (Same Day)

**File Naming Convention:**
```
[ClientName]_[Date]_[Type]_[Number]_[Description]
Example: AcmeRoofing_20250106_Video_01_SpringTips
Example: AcmeRoofing_20250106_Photo_15_TeamHeadshot
```

**Organization Tasks:**
1. Create session folder structure
2. Copy shot list and session notes into folder
3. Rename files with consistent naming convention
4. Create rough groupings by content type
5. Flag obvious bad takes or technical failures (delete or move to "outtakes" folder)

**ClickUp Update:**
- Mark "Capture Session Complete"
- Create task "Edit Media Capture Session - [Client] - Due [5 business days from now]"
- Add session notes to task description

---

## Phase 2: Content Editing (Days 1-4)

### Video Editing Workflow

#### Step 1: Review & Select Best Takes (0.5-1 hour)

**For Each Video on Shot List:**
1. Watch all takes
2. Note which take is best (energy, clarity, no mistakes)
3. Note best sections if combining multiple takes
4. Identify any technical issues needing fixes

**Selection Criteria:**
- Best energy and authenticity
- Cleanest delivery (fewest stumbles)
- Best audio quality
- Best framing/focus
- Most aligned with key message

**Create Edit List:**
```
Video 1 - Spring Roof Tips: Use Take 2 (0:15-1:05)
Video 2 - BTS Process: Use Take 1 intro + Take 3 middle section
Video 3 - Team Spotlight: Use Take 2 complete
```

#### Step 2: Rough Edit Assembly (2-3 hours for 8-12 videos)

**For Each Video:**

1. **Import best takes into editing software**
   - Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or CapCut

2. **Trim to core content**
   - Cut out false starts and endings
   - Remove long pauses or stumbles
   - Keep it tight and engaging
   - Target duration: 30-90 seconds per piece

3. **Basic sequencing**
   - Arrange clips in logical order
   - Add B-roll overlays if applicable
   - Ensure smooth flow

4. **Audio cleanup**
   - Remove background noise (if possible)
   - Normalize audio levels
   - Add subtle background music (if appropriate to brand)
   - Ensure consistent volume across all videos

**Platform Optimization:**
- **Vertical (9:16):** TikTok, Instagram Reels, Facebook Reels
- **Square (1:1):** Instagram Feed, Facebook Feed
- **Horizontal (16:9):** YouTube, LinkedIn (some), GBP

**Create Multiple Aspect Ratios:**
- Export each video in all needed formats
- Adjust framing for vertical (ensure subject stays in frame)
- Test on mobile to verify readability

#### Step 3: Polish & Enhancement (2-3 hours)

**For Each Video:**

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Color correction (consistent look across all videos)
- Brightness/contrast adjustments
- Brand color overlays (if part of brand style)
- Lower thirds (name, title) if applicable

**Text & Graphics:**
- Add captions/subtitles (critical for sound-off viewing)
- Add text overlays for key points
- Intro/outro graphics (if part of brand style)
- Logo placement (subtle, corner)

**Audio Finalization:**
- Final volume balancing
- Fade in/out music
- Ensure dialog is clear and prominent
- Check for any remaining audio issues

**Quality Control:**
- Watch each video start to finish
- Check captions for accuracy
- Verify all graphics are on-brand
- Ensure smooth transitions
- Check for technical glitches

#### Step 4: Export Settings

**Recommended Export Settings:**
- **Format:** MP4 (H.264 codec)
- **Resolution:** 1080p minimum (4K if captured in 4K)
- **Frame Rate:** Match original (usually 24, 30, or 60fps)
- **Bitrate:** 10-20 Mbps (balance quality and file size)
- **Audio:** AAC, 192 kbps or higher

**File Naming:**
```
[ClientName]_[ContentType]_[Platform]_[Number]_[ShortDescription]
Example: AcmeRoofing_Video_Vertical_01_SpringRoofTips
Example: AcmeRoofing_Video_Square_01_SpringRoofTips
```

### Photo Editing Workflow

#### Step 1: Culling & Selection (0.5-1 hour)

**First Pass:**
- Go through all photos quickly
- Flag keepers (star rating or color label)
- Delete obvious rejects (out of focus, bad expressions, technical failures)

**Selection Criteria:**
- Sharp focus
- Good exposure (not too dark or bright)
- Natural expressions
- Clean backgrounds
- Tells a story or supports brand

**Target Quantity:**
- Start with 50-100 raw photos
- Cull to 25-35 best photos
- Edit and deliver 20-30 final photos

#### Step 2: Editing & Enhancement (1-2 hours)

**For Each Selected Photo:**

**Basic Adjustments:**
- Exposure correction
- Color balance/temperature
- Contrast and clarity
- Crop to best composition (rule of thirds)
- Straighten horizons/verticals

**Advanced Adjustments (if needed):**
- Skin tone refinement (portraits)
- Background cleanup (remove distractions)
- Sharpening (subtle)

- **Facebook:** 1200x630 (landscape) or 1080x1080 (square)
- **GBP:** 720x720 minimum, landscape or portrait works
- **LinkedIn:** 1200x627 (landscape)

**File Naming:**
```
[ClientName]_Photo_[Number]_[Description]
Example: AcmeRoofing_Photo_01_OwnerHeadshot
Example: AcmeRoofing_Photo_12_TeamWorkingJobsite
```

**Export Settings:**
- Format: JPEG
- Quality: High (80-90%)
- Resolution: Platform-appropriate sizes
- Color Space: sRGB

### Caption Writing (1-2 hours)

#### Caption Formula

**For Each Piece of Content:**

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (First sentence - grabs attention)
2. **Value** (Main content - educates, entertains, or inspires)
3. **Call-to-Action** (What you want them to do)
4. **Hashtags** (Relevant, targeted)

**Example Caption (Roofing Spring Tips Video):**

```
🏠 Is your roof ready for spring storms?

After a harsh winter, your roof needs attention. Here are 3 things every homeowner should check:

1. Missing or damaged shingles from winter weather
2. Granule buildup in gutters (sign of shingle wear)
3. Flashing around chimneys and vents for gaps

Catching small issues now prevents big problems later.

📞 Need a professional inspection? We offer free roof assessments all spring. Link in bio or call [phone].

#RoofingTips #SpringMaintenance #HomeOwnerTips #RoofCare #[City]Roofing #LocalRoofer
```

**Caption Guidelines:**
- First sentence must hook (people scroll fast)
- Keep it conversational and authentic
- Reference Brand Pillars
- Platform-appropriate length:
  - Instagram: 125-150 words
  - Facebook: 80-120 words
  - TikTok: 100-150 characters (short!)
  - LinkedIn: 150-200 words (can be longer)
  - GBP: 100-150 words

**Hashtag Strategy:**
- 5-10 hashtags per post
- Mix of broad and specific
- Location-specific hashtags
- Industry/niche hashtags
- Branded hashtags (if applicable)

**Create Multiple Versions:**
- If posting to multiple platforms, adapt captions
- Instagram might be more casual
- LinkedIn more professional
- Facebook in between
- TikTok very casual and trend-aware

## Best Practices

### Efficiency Tips

✅ **Use templates** - Save caption templates, export presets, Frame IO structures
✅ **Batch similar tasks** - Edit all videos at once, then all photos
✅ **Create editing presets** - Color grades, text styles, audio settings
✅ **Use keyboard shortcuts** - Speed up editing significantly
✅ **Set calendar blocks** - Dedicated editing time without interruptions

### Quality Standards

✅ **Always export test files** - Check quality before delivering all files
✅ **Watch on mobile** - How it looks on phone is what matters
✅ **Captions are non-negotiable** - 85% of videos watched without sound
✅ **Consistent branding** - Maintain visual consistency across all content
✅ **Proofread everything** - Typos destroy credibility

### Client Communication

✅ **Set clear timelines** - Manage expectations from day one
✅ **Over-communicate** - Update client at each phase
✅ **Celebrate wins** - Share performance of top content
✅ **Document feedback** - Use insights for future sessions
