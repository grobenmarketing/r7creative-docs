## Key Principles to Remember

### Pricing Strategy

**Internal (Company):** Detailed 5-tier structure for flexibility and upsells

### Service Philosophy
**"You Capture, We Create":** Client provides raw content, we handle 85-90% of work

### Target Market
**Primary:** $2-10M revenue local service businesses, 5-20 employees, plateaued growth

### Core Problem Solved
**The 4-Minute Elimination:** Businesses lose qualified leads who eliminate them in 4 minutes based on dead digital profiles

### Transformation Timeline
- **Weeks 2-4:** First "I found you on Google" call
- **Months 2-3:** 1-2 calls/month → 3-4 calls/week
- **Months 6-12:** Calendar booked 2-3 months out, hiring staff

### Founders Pricing
**First 15 clients:** Lifetime pricing lock-in at reduced rates
**After 15 clients:** All new clients pay retail rates
