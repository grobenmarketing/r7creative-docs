**Compared to Other Production Companies:**
- More affordable (typical video agencies charge $1,000-5,000+ per shoot)
- Integrated with ongoing content management (not just "here's your files")
- Content optimized specifically for social/search profiles
- Ongoing relationship vs. transactional project

**Compared to Hiring In-House:**
- No equipment investment needed
- No learning curve or skills development

## Marketing & Sales Talking Points

### Key Messages

**"I Don't Have Time"**

**"I'm Not Good on Camera"**
> "That's what we're here for! We guide you through everything, provide talking points, and direct the whole shoot. Most clients are nervous at first but feel great after seeing how simple and natural we make it."

**"Is It Worth the Cost?"**
> "Great question. Think about it this way: you're either spending 1-2 hours every single week trying to capture content, or you invest 1 hour once a quarter with professional results. Which is more valuable to your business?"

**"Can I Just Keep Doing It Myself?"**
> "Absolutely! Many clients start that way. We're here when you need us - whether that's quarterly, during busy seasons, or as a permanent solution. No pressure either way."
