## Core Positioning

**R7 Creative: We Keep You in the 4-Minute Decision**

We transform invisible local service businesses into visible, lead-generating machines by managing your digital pulse during the critical 4-minute window when customers decide who to call. While competitors focus on an array of unfocused mareketing playbooks, we ensure you survive the browser tab test with recent, authentic proof of active work—turning invisible losses into phone calls.

---

## The Market Reality

Every day, hundreds of potential customers search for a service provider to solver their problem and spend less than 4 minutes deciding who to call. For example, they open 5 businesses on Google Maps, do a quick gut check on the website, then check social media for signs of life, and eliminate 3 based on dead digital profiles and properties. On average, only 1 or 2 businesses get their call or email asking for help. **80% of businesses fail this test daily and never even know it happened.**

### The Customer Journey (The "John Story")

> **See also:** **The John Story** for complete narrative

**Act 1: The Trigger (30 seconds)**
- Boss drops urgent problem on John's desk
- Needs solution provider NOW
- 4 minutes until lunch to figure this out (John's not missing lunch!)

**Act 2: The Search (2 minutes)**
- Google search → Maps results
- Opens 5 businesses with 50+ reviews
- Control-clicks through tabs rapidly

**Act 3: The Elimination (90 seconds)**
- Checks properties (Google Business Profile, website and social profiles) for signs of life
- Dead properties = closed browser tabs
- Active properties = worth calling

**Act 4: The Decision (30 seconds)**
- Down to 2 businesses that "feel right"
- These get the callback after lunch
- The other 3? They never knew John existed

## Our Unique Philosophy

### 1. We Don't "Manage Social Media"—We Manage Your Digital Pulse

During vital decision moments through our proprietary **"You Capture, We Create"** system, we ensure:
- Recent proof of active work (Google Business Profile, Social Media)
- Authentic team and process visibility that build trust
- Consistent signs of life across all search profiles and social media profiles customers check

> **See:** [Unique Value Proposition](/docs/02-marketing/brand-messaging/02-unique-value-proposition) for complete system details

### 2. Everything Flows from Your Brand Pillars

Most agencies skip strategy or charge $1,500 extra. We create a complete 6-part **Brand Pillars & Marketing Position document** for free as part of onboarding. Everything flows from this:
- Content strategy
- Optimization priorities
- Posting calendar
- Messaging consistency
- Website Copy
- Ads
- Captions
- Print Media
This super useful foundational copywriting piece will bring clarity to every piece of marketing content. 

**No guesswork. Just systematic execution.**

### 3. Alignment Across the 4-Minute Decision Window

We create alignment across **Google Business Profile → Website → Social Media** so customers see consistent proof you're:
- Active (not dead/closed)
- Available (not too busy)
- Legitimate (real people, real work)

### 4. We Optimize for Decision-Making, Not Feel-Good Metrics

We don't chase:
- Follower counts
- Like numbers
- Engagement rates
- Impressions

We optimize for:
- **Phone calls** from qualified leads
- **Email inquiries** from ready-to-buy customers
- **Calendar bookings** that convert
- **Revenue growth** that's measurable

## What We Reject

We are **not** for everyone. We deliberately reject:

### ❌ One-Off Tactics and Fragmented Work
We don't do:
- "Just post to social for me"
- "Just optimize my Google profile"
- "Just make me a website"
- "Just edit my video"
- One-time projects without ongoing management

We create complete, integrated systems that work because everything reinforces everything else.

### ❌ Businesses Not Ready to Shift Habits
Our system requires clients to:
- Capture 10-20 minutes of content per week (photos/videos on phone)
- Attend bi-weekly 30-minute strategy calls
- Upload content by Friday 7 PM deadlines
- Review and approve content by Wednesday 5 PM
- Dedicate themselves to 2-3 months of hard work for organic leads
- Maintain the presence of mind to work with us until we see results

If you're not ready to shift these habits, we're not the right fit.

### ❌ Being the Cheapest Option
We're not competing on price. At $550-$950/month, we're:
- More expensive than freelancers on Fiverr
- Less expensive than full-service agencies ($3K-$10K/month)
- Priced at the "value sweet spot" for proven ROI

IMPORTANT: The above prices are Founders pricing availible to the first 15 clients only. Full price is $1200-$1800/month plus a $600 one time implementation fee. 

**We're the option that actually works because it's systematic.**

### ❌ Violating Platform Guidelines for "Fancy" Content
Google Business Profile has strict rules:
- No fancy transitions or motion effects in videos
- No text overlays on photos (unless describing the business location)
- Content must be authentic and representative of actual operations
- Profile must be full and complete
- Favors profiles with matching website content
- Favors profiles with search and AI optimized websites
- Favors profiles with weekly reviews and owner replies
- Favors weekly posts
- Favors weekly media uploads

**We follow these rules** because violating them risks account penalties or removal.
**Feed Google What it Wants**: Google rewards you with traffic.

## Who We Serve Best

### Financial Profile
- **Annual Revenue:** $2-10M (sweet spot: $3M)
- **Team Size:** 5-20 employees (sweet spot: 8 employees)
- **Monthly Budget:** Able to invest $550-$1800/month
- **Business Stage:** Profitable but plateaued

### Current Situation
- **Lead Flow:** Stuck at low number of calls-emails/month (should be 4-5 times higher number of calls-emails/month)
- **Visibility:** Pretty invisible online—dead social, incomplete Google profile, ineffective website, limited to no weekly engagement
- **Urgency:** Finally recognizing that being invisible online is costing them **$10-45K+ quarterly** in lost opportunities
- **Readiness:** Have the time (or staff), money, and urgency to invest in an effective system with demonstrated, proven results

### Industries
Service businesses where customers search online before calling:
- HVAC & Plumbing
- Marketing
- Electrical & Contractors
- Roofing & Home Services
- Commercial Services (cleaning, maintenance)
- Specialty Trades
- B2B Service Providers

## Competitive Position

### What We're REALLY Competing Against

You're **not** competing against other marketing agencies.

You're competing against:

1. **Previous Failed Attempts**
   - DIY social media (gave up after 3 weeks)
   - Cheap freelancers (no strategy, no results)
   - Expensive agencies (thousands spent, no ROI)
   - Website and Canva templates (no intention, not appealing)
   - "Good enough" marketing message (Incomplete profiles, website copy that turns searchers off)

2. **Skepticism About Effectiveness**
   - "My customers don't use social media"
   - "I get business without social media"
   - "This doesn't work for my industry"
   - "I tried this before and it didn't work"
   - "I've never seen this work or hear about it working"
   - "We're already trusted"
   - "What we do is good enough"

3. **Scattered Approaches**
   - Different freelancer for social
   - Different person for Google Business
   - Different agency for website
   - No integration = no results
   - No central brand or marketing message authority (brand pillars)

4. **Deeply Entrenched Beliefs**
   - "Online marketing is overhyped"
   - "This stuff doesn't work"
   - "I don't have time for this"
   - "Marketing is too expensive"
   - "Every marketer I've used or talk to doesn't know what they're doing"

### How We Win

**We prove them wrong in the first 30 days with a free trial.**

Month 1: First "I found you on Google" call
Month 2-3: 1-2 calls/month → 3-4 calls/week
Month 5+: Loyal long-term client because we proved what no one else could

## Key Positioning Statements to Use

### Primary
"We Keep You in the 4-Minute Decision"

### Secondary
- "Human Touch Marketing in an AI & Automated World"
- "Digital Pulse Management During Critical Decision Moments"
- "We Don't Manage Social Media—We Manage Your Digital Pulse"
- **🔴 USER INPUT NEEDED:** Add another secondary positioning statement here...

### Elevator Version
"We help service businesses survive the 4-minute test when urgent customers decide who to call—ensuring you're one of the 2 who get called instead of one of the 3 who get eliminated in browser tabs."

**🔴 USER INPUT NEEDED:** Add two variations of the elevator pitch here...
