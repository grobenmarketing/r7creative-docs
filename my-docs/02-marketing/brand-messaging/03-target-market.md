## Financial Profile

### Revenue & Size
- **Annual Revenue:** $2-10M (sweet spot: $3M)
- **Team Size:** 5-20 employees (sweet spot: 8 employees)
- **Monthly Marketing Budget:** Able to invest $550-$950/month (Founders pricing for first 15 clients; full price $1200-$1800/month + $600 implementation fee)
- **Business Stage:** Profitable but plateaued

### Business Characteristics
- Established track record (not startups)
- Stable operations (not in crisis mode)
- Struggling to grow beyond current level
- Recognize the need but haven't found the solution

---

## Current Situation

### Lead Flow Problem
**Current State:** Stuck at 1-2 calls/month
**Should Be:** Getting 3-4 calls/week
**The Gap:** Missing 10-15 qualified leads monthly = $10-45K+ quarterly loss

### Calendar Status
**Current:** Booking only 2-3 weeks out
**Desired:** Booking 2-3 months out
**The Impact:** Keeps them up at night, can't plan hiring or growth, stressed about cash flow

### Visibility Crisis
- **Dead social profiles:** Last post 6-12 months ago (or never)
- **Incomplete Google Business Profile:** Missing photos, services, hours
- **Outdated website:** Generic, no recent work examples
- **Low, No, Bad Reviews**: People who would give them a chance are turned off
- **Result:** Customers think they're closed, too busy, or not professional

### Urgency Factor
> **"Day late and a dollar short"**

- Hurting on money each week, have been for months/years
- Realizing "not having enough business is catching up with them"
- Should have fixed this years ago but didn't
- Now have even less money and less time to invest
- Progressivey working longer, taking on more to hire help "eventually"

---

## The Trigger Moment

### What Makes Them Realize They Need Help

**1. Internal Conversations**
- Staff/board member says: "We need to get better at this online thing"
- Team discussion about lead generation problems
- Collective recognition that invisibility is costing them

**2. The Google Test**
- Google search their own business
- Find themselves buried on page 2-3 or not showing up at all
- See competitors dominating the results instead
- Reality check: "Our customers can't find us"

**3. Lost Opportunity Awareness**
- Lose a job to anyone who "looked more alive online"
- Customer mentions: "I almost didn't call you—I couldn't tell if you were still..."
- Realize the phone *isn't* ringing/emails aren't coming for a reason
- "Nobody knows we exist"

**4. Calendar Anxiety**
- Work not booked past 3-6 weeks (danger zone)
- Can't justify hiring more staff
- Growth has plateaued despite quality work, superior quality and service

**5. Competitor Envy**
- See competitors everywhere online
- Notice their reviews, social activity, visibility
- Realize they're falling behind

## What They've Already Tried (and Failed)

### Previous Attempts
- ✗ **Hired a sales guy** → Didn't generate enough leads, eventually let him go
- ✗ **Email blasts** → Minimal response, felt spammy
- ✗ **Asked for referrals** → Inconsistent, slow, uncomfortable to ask
- ✗ **Word-of-mouth only** → Unreliable, can't scale, unpredictable
- ✗ **DIY social media** → Gave up after 3 weeks (too time-consuming, no strategy)
- ✗ **Cheap freelancers** → No strategy, inconsistent, no results
- ✗ **Expensive agencies** → Charged thousands, promised "brand awareness," delivered no ROI
- ✗ **Denial**: → This works for others but not for me

### The Skepticism This Creates
- "I tried marketing before and it didn't work"
- "This stuff doesn't work for my industry"
- "My customers don't use social media"
- "I don't have time for this"
- "Marketing is too expensive"

**This is what we're REALLY competing against** — not other agencies, but their past failures, skepticism, and own burn out.

## What They're Really Looking For

### The Ideal Solution (From Their Perspective)

**Someone who:**
- Has the time and money to invest
- Sees this is something they absolutely need
- Has talked with staff/board and decided: *"We know we need somebody to do this, and we're willing to pay for it"*
- Is willing to change habits (capture content weekly, attend bi-weekly meetings)
- Understands this is an investment that pays back in 2-3 months

### The Decision Factor

They're willing to take a risk on something new, but they need to see **social proof** before committing long-term.

**That's why the 30-day no cost trial is so effective:**
- Removes all risk from their decision
- Lets them see results before paying
- Proves what no one else could
- Converts skeptics into loyal advocates

**Timeline to loyalty:**
- **Month 1:** First "found you on Google" call → Belief
- **Months 2-3:** 3-4 calls/week → Relief
- **Months 4-12:** Loyal long-term client → Advocacy

## What Disqualifies Them

### Red Flags (Don't Take These Clients)

**Financial:**
- ❌ Can't afford $550-$950/month
- ❌ Looking for the cheapest option (not the option that works)
- ❌ Expect instant ROI in first 30 days

**Operational:**
- ❌ Don't have anyone on staff who can capture content
- ❌ Refuse to shift habits or change processes
- ❌ Won't attend bi-weekly 20-minute strategy calls
- ❌ Miss deadlines consistently (content uploads, reviews)

**Expectations:**
- ❌ Expect instant results or overnight miracles
- ❌ Want full-service video production with fancy transitions (we follow Google Business Profile platform guidelines for authenticity - no fancy transitions, no text overlays, authentic content only)
- ❌ Think this is "set it and forget it" (requires collaboration)
- ❌ Want to micromanage every detail (trust is essential)
- ❌ Want to violate platform guidelines for "fancier" content (risks account penalties)

**Mindset:**
- ❌ Not willing to believe it can work
- ❌ Won't change their mind even with proof
- ❌ Blame external factors for everything
- ❌ Unwilling to invest in growth

### Why These Disqualify

The "You Capture, We Create" system **requires collaboration.**

If they can't/won't:
- Capture 10-20 minutes/week of content
- Attend bi-weekly meetings
- Meet deadlines
- Trust the process

**Then it won't work for either party.**
