## CASE STUDY 1: US SOLAR — FROM CANCELLATIONS TO BOOKED CALENDAR

**The Problem:**
6 out of 10 scheduled appointments were canceling. Calendar only booked 4 weeks out. Only 8 Google reviews. Dead social media. Prospects were eliminating them before they even called.

**The Solution:**
We brought their digital storefront to life. Weekly photos of installations. Customer testimonials. Team introductions. Engaged with every review like a business owner who cares. Consistent presence across all platforms.

**The Result:**
Appointment show-up rate climbed from 30% to 60-70%. Revenue jumped. Calendar now books 3 months out consistently.

**Their Words:** "We were getting too many appointment cancellations. After we fixed our search presence, the growth was unbelievable." — Alan, Marketing Director

## CASE STUDY 2: YODER GRAPHICS — INVISIBLE TO LANDING MAJOR CONTRACTS

**The Problem:**
Completely invisible online. Missing opportunities from large companies searching for local vendors. Two weeks from zero visibility online.

**The Solution:**
Turned on their digital presence. Active social media posts. Complete Google Business Profile. Fresh photos. Regular updates.

**The Result:**
A major power company found them on Facebook, checked their Google profile, visited their website, and awarded them a $100K+ contract to wrap 47 vehicles.

**Their Words:** "Everyone tells me they've seen us on social media and love it. Less price resistance too." — Mark, President

## CASE STUDY 3: POWER WASH PROS — NO SEARCHES, NOW RINGING PHONE

**The Problem:**
Dead Google Business Profile. Zero phone calls from online searches. Working hard but invisible when it mattered most.

**The Solution:**
Within days, we activated their digital presence. Weekly posts. Fresh photos. Responses to all reviews. Real proof they were actively serving customers.

**The Result:**
First week: A customer called saying "I found you on your Google profile page." One month later: 3-4 calls per week from online searches.

**Their Words:** "For years the phone would ring and emails would come in normally. After we did this, we started getting calls from people who found us on Google." — Cody, Owner/Operator
