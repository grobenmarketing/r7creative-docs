# Business Description Guide

## Overview
The GBP business description (750 characters max) is one of the most important elements of your profile. It must incorporate brand pillars, keywords, and positioning while following Google's guidelines.

**Reference:** See `/_reference/Google Business Profile ranking.md` for Google's official recommendations

---

## Google's Requirements

### What's Allowed
- Description of what your business does
- Products and services offered
- Service area or location information
- Business history or background
- What makes you unique

### What's NOT Allowed
- URLs or HTML tags
- Special characters (★, ♥, etc.)
- Promotional language ("Best!", "Amazing!")
- Excessive CAPITALIZATION
- Prices or offers (use posts instead)
- Phone numbers (already in profile)
- Links to social media

---

## Description Formula

### Structure (750 characters)

**Opening (150 characters):** WHO you are + PRIMARY differentiator
**Middle (400 characters):** WHAT you do + supporting details + keywords
**Closing (200 characters):** WHERE you serve + call to action

---

## Template

```
[Business name] is [what makes you different - Brand Pillar #1]. [Founded/background detail that builds credibility].

We specialize in [primary services with keywords] for [target customer] in [service area]. [Brand Pillar #2 - how you serve customers differently]. [Services list incorporating keywords naturally]. [Brand Pillar #3 or proof point].

Serving [cities/areas] since [year]. [Call to action with benefit].
```

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Gather Information
- [ ] Review brand pillars document
- [ ] Review competitive positioning statement
- [ ] Review key messaging hierarchy
- [ ] Identify primary keywords (services + location)
- [ ] Note proof points (years, credentials, stats)

### Step 2: Draft Opening Sentence
Focus on PRIMARY differentiator

**Formula Options:**
- "[Business name] provides [service] with [unique approach] in [location]"
- "Since [year], [business name] has been [differentiation] for [target customer]"
- "[Business name] is [city's] [specialization] for [specific service]"

**TODO: Draft 3 opening sentence options**
1.
2.
3.

### Step 3: Write Middle Section
List services with natural keyword integration

**Tips:**
- Use service keywords naturally
- Group related services
- Include service area if not in opening
- Mention target customer type
- Weave in brand pillars

**TODO: Draft middle section**

### Step 4: Write Closing
Location + call to action

**Formula:**
"Serving [service area] since [year]. [Call to action with benefit]."

**Examples:**
- "Serving Austin homeowners since 2005. Call today for same-day service."
- "Proudly serving the greater Phoenix area. Schedule your free consultation."

**TODO: Draft closing**

### Step 5: Combine & Count
- [ ] Paste all sections together
- [ ] Count characters (max 750)
- [ ] Remove filler words if over limit
- [ ] Read aloud for natural flow
- [ ] Check against Google's guidelines
