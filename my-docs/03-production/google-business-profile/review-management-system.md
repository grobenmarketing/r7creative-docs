# Review Management System

## Overview
A systematic approach to requesting, monitoring, and responding to Google reviews to build prominence and trust.

---

## Review Request Strategy

### Who to Ask
- Recent customers (within 3-7 days of service completion)
- Satisfied customers only
- Customers who verbally expressed satisfaction
- Never incentivize reviews (against Google policy)

### How to Ask

**In-Person Request Script:**
<!-- TODO: Customize for your business -->
"[Client name], I'm so glad we could help with [project]. If you're happy with our work, would you be willing to leave us a review on Google? It really helps other [target customers] find us."

**Email Request Template:**
<!-- TODO: Create email template -->

**Text Message Request:**
<!-- TODO: Create text template if using -->

**Review Link:**
- [ ] Create short review link (Google's Place ID method)
- [ ] Create QR code for easy mobile access
- [ ] TODO: Document your review link here

---

## Review Monitoring

### Setup
- [ ] Enable email notifications for new reviews
- [ ] Check GBP daily (or set up monitoring tool)
- [ ] Assign responsibility for monitoring

### Response Timeline
- Positive reviews: Respond within 24-48 hours
- Negative reviews: Respond within 12-24 hours
- Questions in reviews: Respond immediately

## Response Templates

### Positive Review Response Formula

**Structure:**
1. Thank them by name
2. Reference specific service or detail they mentioned
3. Reinforce brand pillar or differentiator
4. Invite them back

**Template:**
```
Thank you, [Name]! We're so glad we could help with [specific service they mentioned]. [Reinforce brand value - e.g., "Providing fast, reliable service is what we're all about."]. We hope to serve you again in the future!
```

**Examples:**
<!-- TODO: Write 3-5 example responses for common positive review types -->

---

### Negative Review Response Formula

**Structure:**
1. Acknowledge and apologize
2. Take conversation offline
3. Commit to resolution (without overpromising)
4. Professional tone (never defensive)

**Template:**
```
We're sorry to hear about your experience, [Name]. This isn't the level of service we strive for. We'd like to make this right. Please contact us directly at [phone] or [email] so we can discuss and resolve this. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.
```

**Important:**
- Never argue publicly
- Never blame the customer
- Always take conversation offline for details
- Follow up privately to resolve

---

### Neutral/Mixed Review Response

**Template:**
```
Thank you for your feedback, [Name]. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience. [Acknowledge positive aspects they mentioned]. [Address concern if appropriate]. We're always working to improve. If you'd like to discuss further, please reach out at [contact info].
```
