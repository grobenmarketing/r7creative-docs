# Services Section Optimization

## Overview
The services section allows you to list all services with descriptions and optional pricing.

---

## Service Listing Strategy

**Structure Each Service:**
- Service name (keyword-optimized)
- Description (300 characters max)
- Price or price range (optional, depends on industry)
- Category grouping

---

## Example Service Entries

**Service Name:** [Primary Keyword] + [Specific Service]
Example: "Emergency Plumbing Repair"

**Description Template:**
```
[What's included]. [How you do it differently - brand pillar connection]. [Benefit to customer]. [Service area if relevant].
```

---

## TODO: List All Services

**Category 1: [Service Category Name]**

**Service 1:**
- Name:
- Description:
- Price:

**Service 2:**
- Name:
- Description:
- Price:

**[Repeat for all services]**

---

## Best Practices

- List all services you actually provide
- Use keyword-rich service names
- Write unique descriptions (don't duplicate)
- Include pricing if it doesn't vary widely
- Group related services together
- Reference brand pillars in descriptions
