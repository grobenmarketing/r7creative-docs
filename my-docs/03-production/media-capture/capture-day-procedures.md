# On-Site Capture Day Procedures

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step procedures for executing a professional, efficient, and successful on-site capture session. Following this workflow ensures consistent quality, maximizes time efficiency, and creates a positive client experience.

**Session Duration:** 1-2 hours (planned for 2-hour window with buffer)

---

## Pre-Arrival (15-20 Minutes Before)

###  Final Preparation

**In Your Vehicle:**
- Review shot list one more time
- Check that all equipment is accessible
- Have client's phone number ready
- Take a moment to get focused and energized

**Text Client:**
> "Hi [Client Name]! I'm about 15 minutes away. See you soon!"

**Benefits:**
- Confirms you're on time
- Gives client heads-up to wrap up what they're doing
- Professional courtesy

---

## Arrival & Setup (0:00 - 0:15)

### Step 1: Arrival & Introduction (0:00 - 0:05)

**Park & Unload:**
- Find appropriate parking
- Gather essential equipment first (camera, tripod, lighting)
- Leave backup gear in vehicle initially (reduce clutter)

**Greet Client Professionally:**
- Warm, confident introduction
- Brief handshake/greeting
- "Thanks for having me today! I'm excited to capture some great content for you."

**Quick Logistics:**
- Where can I set up my equipment briefly?
- Which areas are we using today?
- Are team members available if we planned for them?
- Any last-minute questions or concerns?

### Step 2: Location Scout & Setup (0:05 - 0:15)

**Walk Through Spaces:**
- Quickly assess each location on shot list
- Note lighting conditions
- Identify potential background distractions
- Confirm backup indoor space if weather affects outdoor shots

**Choose First Setup:**
- Start with easiest/most comfortable setup
- Usually: simple talking head in good natural light
- Builds client confidence with a quick win

**Technical Setup:**
- Set up camera on tripod
- Position key light (if needed)
- Test audio levels with client speaking
- Check framing and focus
- Do a 10-second test recording and play back

**Pro Tip:** Explain what you're doing as you set up - demystifies the process and keeps client comfortable.

## Capture Execution (0:15 - 1:45)

### Step 3: First Shot - Build Confidence (0:15 - 0:30)

**Start With Something Easy:**
- Choose a straightforward talking head from shot list
- Topic the client knows well
- Short duration (30-60 seconds)

**Pre-Shot Client Prep:**

> "Alright [Client], we're going to start with [Topic]. This is going to be about 30-60 seconds. I'll give you the talking points, and you can speak naturally - don't worry about being perfect. We can do multiple takes, and I'll edit out any pauses or mistakes. Sound good?"

**Provide Clear Direction:**

> "Here are the three points to hit:
> 1. [Point 1]
> 2. [Point 2]
> 3. [Point 3]
>
> Just speak naturally like you're talking to a customer or friend. Ready? Let's do a practice run first."

**Practice Run:**
- Do NOT record the practice
- Let them get comfortable
- Provide immediate feedback: "That was great! Maybe a bit slower on point 2, but that was perfect."
- Builds confidence

**Record First Take:**
1. "Okay, this is the real one. Camera is rolling in 3... 2... 1... [go]"
2. Let them complete full thought
3. "Perfect! Let's do one more for safety."
4. Record second take
5. "Awesome! Got it. That felt good, right?"

**Why This Works:**
- Quick win builds momentum
- Client sees it's not as scary as they thought
- You establish the rhythm for the rest of the shoot
- Gets past initial nervousness

---

### Step 4: Work Through Shot List (0:30 - 1:30)

**Efficient Sequencing:**

**Group by Location:**
- All talking heads in location A
- All behind-the-scenes in location B
- All outdoor shots together
- Minimizes setup changes

**Group by Participant:**
- All owner shots together
- All team member shots together
- Minimizes participant time investment

**Vary Intensity:**
- Alternate between easier and harder shots
- Give breaks if client seems tired
- Keep energy high with encouragement

---

### Talking Head Video Procedure

**For Each Talking Head:**

1. **Frame the shot**
   - Rule of thirds (eyes in upper third)
   - Appropriate headroom
   - Clean background (no distractions)
   - Check for "growing plants" out of head

2. **Check lighting**
   - Soft, flattering light on face
   - No harsh shadows
   - Avoid backlighting (windows behind subject)
   - Use LED panel if needed

3. **Audio check**
   - Lav mic attached and hidden
   - Test audio levels (should peak around -12dB)
   - Listen for background noise
   - Ask client to speak at normal volume

4. **Provide talking points**
   - Read the 3-4 key points
   - Emphasize: speak naturally, not scripted
   - "Just like you're explaining this to a customer"
   - Encourage personal stories or examples

5. **Record multiple takes**
   - Take 1: Full run-through
   - Take 2: "One more for safety"
   - Take 3 (if needed): "Let's try it one more time, maybe a bit [faster/slower/more energy]"
   - Best practice: 2-3 takes per piece

6. **Quick review**
   - Play back to check technical quality (focus, audio, framing)
   - Don't show client unless they ask (creates self-consciousness)
   - Note which take was best in your shot list

---

### Behind-the-Scenes / B-Roll Procedure

**For Process/Behind-the-Scenes:**

1. **Capture the action**
   - Film actual work happening (don't stage it)
   - Get multiple angles of same action
   - Close-ups and wide shots
   - At least 10 seconds per clip

2. **Add narration option**
   - Film silent B-roll first
   - Then record voiceover explanation separately
   - OR have client narrate while you film

3. **Get variety**
   - Wide establishing shots
   - Medium shots showing detail
   - Close-ups on hands, tools, products
   - "Over the shoulder" perspective shots

**B-Roll Shot Checklist:**
- [ ] Wide establishing shot (shows context)
- [ ] Medium shots (shows action/process)
- [ ] Close-ups (details, hands working, results)
- [ ] Multiple angles of key actions
- [ ] 10+ seconds per clip minimum
- [ ] Movement (pans, walk-throughs) for visual interest

---

### Team Member / Guest Participant Procedure

**Respect Their Time:**
- Give 5-minute heads-up before needed
- Have everything ready when they arrive
- Limit their involvement to 10-15 minutes max
- Thank them genuinely for participating

**Make Them Comfortable:**

> "Hi [Name], thanks for doing this! This will only take about 10 minutes. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and you just answer naturally. There's no wrong answer, and we can do multiple takes. Sound good?"

**Question-and-Answer Format Works Best:**
- You ask questions off-camera
- They answer naturally
- Edit out your questions in post
- Feels like conversation, not performance

**Sample Questions (for team member spotlight):**
- "Tell me your name and what you do here."
- "How long have you been with [Company]?"
- "What's your favorite part of working here?"
- "What do you want customers to know about our team?"

**Keep It Short:**
- 3-4 questions max
- 30-60 seconds total output per person
- Thank them and let them get back to work

---

### Photo Capture Procedure

**Intersperse Throughout Video Shooting:**
- Grab photos between video setups
- Don't dedicate separate "photo time" (inefficient)
- Capture candids during behind-the-scenes video

**Photo Shot List:**

**Headshots:**
- Professional headshot of owner
- Individual team member headshots
- Group team photo
- Tips: Natural light, clean background, direct eye contact with camera

**Action Shots:**
- Employees working
- Customer interactions (with permission)
- Process in action
- Team collaboration
- Tips: Capture genuine moments, vary angles, tell a story

**Location Shots:**
- Exterior of building/facility
- Interior workspace/showroom
- Detail shots (equipment, products, signage)
- Before/after (if applicable to business)

**Quick Photo Tips:**
- Take 3-5 of each setup (different expressions, slight variations)
- Check focus and exposure immediately
- Direct subjects: "Look here," "Smile naturally," "One serious, one smiling"
- Candids work better than posed for action shots

---

## Managing the Shoot (Ongoing)

### Time Management

**Track Time Discreetly:**
- Glance at watch/phone between setups
- Know your halfway point (45-50 minutes in)
- Prioritize must-have shots from list
- Be flexible to cut nice-to-have shots if running behind

**If Running Over:**
- Check with client: "We're at [time] - are you good to continue for another 15-20 minutes, or should we wrap up what we have?"
- Most clients will say continue (they're invested now)
- If not, capture remaining priority items quickly

**If Ahead of Schedule:**
- Don't rush to finish early
- Add bonus shots not on list
- Capture extra B-roll
- Get variations of best pieces
- More content = more options in editing

### Client Energy Management

**Watch for Fatigue:**
- Client energy typically peaks at 20-30 minutes
- Starts to decline after 60 minutes
- Adjust accordingly

**Keep Energy High:**
- Genuine encouragement: "That was perfect!" "Great energy!" "Love that!"
- Take brief 2-3 minute breaks between major setups
- Stay positive and upbeat yourself (energy is contagious)
- Make it fun - laugh, keep it light

**If Client Is Struggling:**
- "Let's take a quick 5-minute break"
- Switch to easier content (B-roll, photos)
- Come back to challenging piece later
- Or: "We have plenty - let's call this one good and move on"

### Technical Troubleshooting

**Common Issues & Quick Fixes:**

**Issue: Audio has background noise**
- Move to quieter location
- Wait for noise to pass (traffic, HVAC cycle)
- Use directional mic instead of lav
- Note it for post-production cleanup

**Issue: Bad lighting/shadows**
- Reposition subject relative to windows
- Add LED panel light
- Move to different location
- Shoot from different angle

**Issue: Client keeps stumbling on words**
- Break talking points into smaller chunks
- Ask questions instead (easier than monologue)
- Reassure: "This is totally normal - we'll edit it perfectly"
- Take a break and come back to it

**Issue: Equipment failure**
- Always have backup (second camera or smartphone)
- Check battery levels throughout
- Have extra memory cards ready
- Stay calm - client takes cues from you

## Wrap-Up & Departure (1:45 - 2:00)

### Step 5: Final Shots & Quality Check (1:45 - 1:55)

**Review Shot List:**
- Did we get all priority items?
- Any quick additions while we're here?
- Anything client wants to redo?

**Quick Quality Check:**
- Scroll through footage/photos
- Verify nothing is obviously out of focus or corrupted
- Check that audio recorded properly
- Better to catch issues now than after you leave

**Capture Bonus Content:**
- If time allows, grab extra B-roll
- Additional angles of best pieces
- Spontaneous moments or ideas
- These often become great content

### Step 6: Client Debrief (1:55 - 2:00)

**Set Expectations:**

> "That was awesome! We got [X number] of great pieces today. Here's what happens next:
>
> 1. I'll edit all of this over the next 3-5 business days
> 2. I'll upload everything to Frame IO for your review
> 3. You'll be able to review and request any edits
> 4. Once approved, we'll schedule and publish according to your content calendar
>
> You should see edited content in Frame IO by [specific date]. Any questions?"

**Thank Them Genuinely:**
- "Thanks so much for your time and energy today"
- "You did great on camera!"
- "This is going to look fantastic"

**Confirm Next Session (if Quarterly):**
- "Our next session is scheduled for [Date]. I'll reach out about 2 weeks before to plan."
- Add to both calendars if not already done

**Leave Business Cards:**
- In case they think of questions later
- For team members who participated
- Shows professionalism

### Step 7: Pack Up & Depart (2:00)

**Efficient Breakdown:**
- Pack equipment systematically
- Don't leave anything behind
- Double-check all locations used

**Professional Exit:**
- Thank receptionist/anyone who helped
- Friendly goodbye to client
- "Looking forward to showing you the content!"

## Immediately After Leaving

### In Your Vehicle

**Backup Footage (Critical):**
- Before driving away, verify all files are on memory card
- If possible, copy to backup drive or upload to cloud immediately
- Don't risk losing footage to equipment failure or theft

**Take Notes:**
- Which takes were best for each piece
- Any client preferences or comments
- Ideas that came up during shoot
- Issues encountered or lessons learned

**Update ClickUp:**
- Mark "Capture Session Complete"
- Add any relevant notes
- Set task for editing phase
