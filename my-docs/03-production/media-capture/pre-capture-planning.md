# Pre-Capture Planning Workflow

## Overview

Proper pre-capture planning is the difference between a chaotic, inefficient shoot and a smooth, productive session that delivers exactly what the client needs. This document outlines the complete planning process from service agreement to capture day.

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks between agreement signing and first capture session

---

## Phase 1: Initial Setup & Logistics (Days 1-3)

### Service Agreement & Payment

**Complete Before Planning Begins:**
✅ Service agreement signed
✅ Payment processed or billing set up
✅ Quarterly capture sessions scheduled (if applicable)
✅ Client added to Media Capture tracking in ClickUp

### Capture Session Scheduling

**Schedule All Sessions Upfront (Quarterly Package):**
- Session 1: [Month 1, specific date/time]
- Session 2: [Month 2, specific date/time]
- Session 3: [Month 3, specific date/time]

**Scheduling Best Practices:**
- Morning sessions (9-11 AM): Best natural light, client energy
- Avoid Mondays (busy start to week) and Fridays (client distraction)
- Tuesday-Thursday mid-morning is ideal
- Book 2-hour window (allows buffer for setup and overrun)
- Add to client AND team calendar with reminders

### Location Confirmation

**Primary Questions:**
1. **Where will we shoot?**
   - Office/storefront
   - Job site(s)
   - Multiple locations in one session
   - Any special access requirements

2. **What's available at the location?**
   - Indoor spaces (lighting, backgrounds, noise)
   - Outdoor areas (weather backup plan)
   - Power outlets for equipment
   - Parking and load-in access

3. **Who needs to be notified?**
   - Building security/management
   - Receptionists/gatekeepers
   - Team members who will participate
   - Customers/clients who may be present

**Logistics Checklist Email to Client:**
