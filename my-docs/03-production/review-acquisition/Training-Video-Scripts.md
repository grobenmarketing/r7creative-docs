### SCRIPT

**[0:00 - 0:15] OPENING**

*[On screen: Your logo, "GUIDED Review Acquisition System"]*

Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to walk you through a review acquisition system that has helped businesses go from a handful of Google reviews to hundreds or even thousands in less than a year.

**[0:15 - 0:45] THE PROBLEM**

*[On screen: Show example of business with only 6 reviews vs competitor with 400+]*

Here's the challenge most businesses face: You do great work, your customers are happy, but you only have a handful of Google reviews. Meanwhile, your competitors have hundreds. And you've tried the typical approaches—sending follow-up emails, text message requests—and they barely work.

Sound familiar?

**[0:45 - 1:15] THE SOLUTION**

*[On screen: Before/After stats - "6 Reviews → 1,893 Reviews in 12 Months"]*

The problem isn't that customers don't want to leave reviews. The problem is that we're asking at the wrong time, in the wrong way.

This system is built on one critical insight: Reviews are earned in-person, in the moment—not requested later via email or text.

When we applied this principle with a solar company in Florida, they went from 6 reviews to nearly 1,900 reviews in about a year, making them the most reviewed company in their category in the entire state.

**[1:15 - 2:00] THE FRAMEWORK**

*[On screen: Display the GUIDED acronym, revealing each letter]*

The system is called GUIDED, and it stands for:

- **G**oogle Algorithm Understanding
- **U**ncover Review Opportunities
- **I**n-Person Ask Process
- **D**eployment Tools
- **E**nhance with Media
- **D**evelop Review Culture

Each letter represents a critical component of the system, and we're going to walk through all of them in this training series.

**[2:00 - 2:45] WHAT TO EXPECT**

*[On screen: Video thumbnails showing upcoming videos]*

In the next few videos, you'll learn:

- How to set up your review tools in under 30 minutes
- The exact conversation script for asking for reviews in-person
- How to get customers to add photos and videos to their reviews
- How to build a sustainable review culture in your company
- How to respond to reviews in a way that boosts your Google rankings

**[2:45 - 3:15] THE COMMITMENT**

*[Back to talking head]*

Here's what I need from you: Commit to following this system for 90 days. That's it.

If you implement this consistently for 90 days, you should have 60 to 100+ new reviews—maybe more, depending on your customer volume.

**[3:15 - 3:30] CLOSING**

*[On screen: "Let's get started" + Next video thumbnail]*

The implementation guide you received covers every detail in writing. These videos will show you exactly how to execute each step.

Let's get started with Video 2: Setting Up Your Tools.

---

### Production Notes:

**On-Screen Graphics Needed**:
- GUIDED acronym animation
- Before/after review count stats
- Video series thumbnail grid

**B-Roll Suggestions**:
- Google Maps business listings
- Mobile phone showing Google reviews
- Customer service interactions (stock footage okay)

---

## Video 2: Setting Up Your QR Code & Tools

**Length**: 2-3 minutes
**Purpose**: Walk through technical setup step-by-step
**Format**: Screen recording with voiceover

---

### SCRIPT

**[0:00 - 0:10] OPENING**

*[Screen: Desktop view]*

In this video, we're going to set up all the tools you need for the GUIDED system. This should take you about 20-30 minutes total.

**[0:10 - 0:45] STEP 1: FIND YOUR PLACE ID**

*[Screen recording: Navigate to Google Maps]*

First, we need to create your direct Google review link. To do this, we need your Google Business Profile Place ID.

Here's how to find it:

1. Go to Google Maps
2. Search for your business name
3. Click on your business listing
4. Click the "Share" button
5. Copy the link

*[Show clicking through each step]*

Now paste this into a text document. See this long string of characters after "place/" in the URL? That's your Place ID. Copy just that part.

**[0:45 - 1:15] STEP 2: CREATE YOUR REVIEW LINK**

*[Screen: Show text editor or document]*

Now we're going to create your direct review link. Copy this URL structure:

```
https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=
```

Paste your Place ID right after the equals sign, with no spaces.

*[Show the complete URL being created]*

Now copy this complete URL and paste it into your browser to test it.

*[Show browser opening to Google review page]*

Perfect! It should take you directly to the review form for your business.

**[1:15 - 1:45] STEP 3: CREATE A SHORT LINK (OPTIONAL)**

*[Screen: Navigate to bit.ly]*

This step is optional but recommended. We're going to create a short link that's easier to manage.

Go to bit.ly or tinyurl.com and create a free account if you don't have one.

Paste your long Google review link and create a custom short link. Something like "bit.ly/review-yourcompany"

*[Show creating the short link]*

The benefit here is that you can update where this link goes later if needed, without having to reprint QR codes.

**[1:45 - 2:30] STEP 4: GENERATE YOUR QR CODE**

*[Screen: Navigate to qr-code-generator.com]*

Now let's create your QR code.

Go to any free QR code generator. I'm using qr-code-generator.com.

1. Paste your review link (or your short link)
2. Download the QR code as a PNG file
3. Save it to your computer and phone

*[Show each step]*

Test it by opening your phone's camera and scanning the QR code. It should open directly to your Google review page.

**[2:30 - 2:50] STEP 5: DEPLOY YOUR QR CODE**

*[Screen: Show example business cards, posters]*

Now you'll want to:

1. Save the QR code image to your phone (for showing customers)
2. Order business cards with the QR code printed on them
3. Print some 8x11 posters for your office or service vehicles

I've included a business card template and poster template in your download folder.

**[2:50 - 3:00] CLOSING**

And that's it! Your technical setup is complete. In the next video, we'll cover the most important part: the in-person ask process.

---

### Production Notes:

**Screen Recording Requirements**:
- High-quality screen capture (1080p minimum)
- Mouse movements should be slow and deliberate
- Pause for 2-3 seconds on each completed step

**Downloads to Include**:

## Video 3: The Perfect In-Person Ask - Live Demonstration

**Length**: 5-7 minutes
**Purpose**: Demonstrate the exact conversation flow
**Format**: Live role-play demonstration

---

### SCRIPT

**[0:00 - 0:20] OPENING**

*[On screen: Two people in a service scenario - service provider and customer]*

This is the most important video in the entire series. What you're about to see is the exact conversation flow that generated nearly 1,900 reviews in a year.

I'm going to demonstrate this with [Name], who will play a satisfied customer who just received service.

**[0:20 - 1:00] STEP 1: CHECK SATISFACTION**

*[Role play begins]*

**Service Rep**: "Hey [Customer Name], how did everything go today? Are you happy with the installation?"

**Customer**: "Yeah, it looks great! You guys did a really good job."

**Service Rep**: "That's wonderful to hear!"

*[Freeze frame - talking head insert]*

**Narrator**: "Notice how I started with an open-ended question. If they had said anything negative, I would NOT ask for a review. I'd address the problem first. But they're happy, so let's continue."

*[Resume role play]*

**[1:00 - 1:40] STEP 2 & 3: SET CONTEXT & MAKE THE ASK**

**Service Rep**: "You know, the final part of our service process is to ask you to review us on Google. The best thing that would really help me personally is if we could do that right now—I know life gets busy and it's so easy to forget. Would you mind taking out your phone?"

**Customer**: "Oh, uh, sure, I can do that."

*[Freeze frame - talking head insert]*

**Narrator**: "Let's break down what just happened. I said:
1. 'Final part of our process' - this normalizes the ask
2. 'Help me personally' - makes it personal, not corporate
3. 'Right now' - creates urgency
4. 'Life gets busy' - shows I understand their reality
5. 'Take out your phone' - specific action request

This language is critical. Practice it exactly like this."

*[Resume role play]*

**[1:40 - 2:20] STEP 4: DEPLOY QR CODE**

**Service Rep**: *[Pulls out phone]* "Perfect! Just scan this QR code and it'll take you right to our review page."

**Customer**: *[Scans with phone]* "Okay, got it."

**Service Rep**: "Sometimes you need to sign into your Google account first—do you need any help with that?"

**Customer**: "No, I think I'm good. It's already logged in."

*[Freeze frame - talking head insert]*

**Narrator**: "Always offer help with the tech. About 20% of customers need assistance signing into Google. Just be patient and walk them through it."

*[Resume role play]*

**[2:20 - 3:10] STEP 5: GUIDE CONTENT**

**Customer**: "So what should I write?"

**Service Rep**: "Just share your honest experience—maybe mention something specific like how the crew kept everything clean, or how we communicated throughout the process. Whatever stood out to you. And if you could include my name in there, that would be really helpful for me personally."

**Customer**: "Okay, let me think... *[starts typing]*"

*[Freeze frame - talking head insert]*

**Narrator**: "See how I gave them specific ideas without scripting their review? This keeps reviews varied and authentic. And asking them to mention your name by name creates personal accountability and helps with team recognition later."

*[Resume role play]*

**[3:10 - 4:00] STEP 6: REQUEST MEDIA**

**Service Rep**: *[Customer is typing]* "Before you send that, would it be too much trouble to add a quick photo? Those really help other customers see the quality of our work."

**Customer**: "Oh, I don't think I took any pictures..."

**Service Rep**: "No problem! Let me text you a couple of photos we took of the installation, and you can just attach one if you want."

*[Shows texting photos]*

**Customer**: *[Receives photos]* "Oh perfect! Let me add this one."

*[Freeze frame - talking head insert]*

**Narrator**: "Reviews with photos rank significantly higher in Google. By having photos ready on your phone, you make this effortless for the customer. About 30-40% of reviews should have media if you make this a habit."

*[Resume role play]*

**[4:00 - 4:40] STEP 7: THE RELEASE**

**Service Rep**: "I really appreciate you doing this. I don't want to look over your shoulder, so tap whatever star rating you feel we deserve. I just ask that you hit 'send' before we wrap up here, if that's okay."

*[Steps back slightly, gives customer space]*

**Customer**: *[Taps 5 stars, writes, attaches photo, hits submit]* "There you go! All set."

*[Freeze frame - talking head insert]*

**Narrator**: "This step is critical. By saying 'tap whatever stars you feel we deserve,' you remove the pressure and show confidence in your service. It gives them psychological permission to be authentic. But by asking them to 'hit send before we wrap up,' you maintain the completion momentum."

*[Resume role play]*

**[4:40 - 5:00] STEP 8: THANK THEM**

**Service Rep**: "Thank you so much! This really does make a difference for our business. Have a great day!"

**Customer**: "No problem, you too!"

---

**[5:00 - 6:00] HANDLING "I'LL DO IT LATER"**

*[New scene - same two people]*

**Narrator**: "Now let's see what happens when a customer says they'll do it later."

---

**Service Rep**: "The final part of our process is to ask you to review us on Google. Would you mind doing that right now?"

**Customer**: "You know what, I'm actually in a bit of a rush. Can I do it later?"

**Service Rep**: "Absolutely, no problem at all! Here's a business card with a QR code—you can scan it whenever you have a moment. I really appreciate it."

*[Hands card, smiles]*

---

*[Back to narrator talking head]*

**Narrator**: "Notice how I didn't push? Respecting boundaries is important. About 10% of these will actually complete later—most won't. That's okay. You'll get plenty from the in-person completions."

**[6:00 - 6:30] PRACTICE POINTS**

*[Back to talking head]*

The first few times you do this, it will feel awkward. That's normal. After about 5-10 times, it becomes completely natural.

In your implementation guide, you'll find role-playing scenarios to practice with your team. Make time to practice these—it's the difference between success and failure.

**[6:30 - 6:45] CLOSING**

In the next video, we'll cover how to handle objections and difficult situations.

---

### Production Notes:

## Video 4: Handling Common Objections

**Length**: 3-4 minutes
**Purpose**: Build confidence for handling difficult situations
**Format**: Quick scenario demonstrations

---

### SCRIPT

**[0:00 - 0:15] OPENING**

*[Talking head]*

You're going to encounter objections and questions. Let's cover the most common ones and exactly how to handle them.

**[0:15 - 0:50] OBJECTION 1: "I'M NOT TECH-SAVVY"**

*[Quick role-play]*

**Customer**: "I'm really not good with technology..."

**Service Rep**: "No worries at all! I'll walk you through every single step. First, just point your camera at this code... great! Now tap the notification... perfect! See? You're doing great."

*[Back to narrator]*

**Narrator**: "Be patient, be encouraging, walk them through step-by-step. About 20% of customers need this level of guidance. That's fine—it's part of the process."

**[0:50 - 1:25] OBJECTION 2: "I DON'T LEAVE REVIEWS"**

*[Quick role-play]*

**Customer**: "I don't really leave reviews for businesses..."

**Service Rep**: "I completely understand—this is actually the first review for a lot of our customers too. It would really help me personally if you'd consider it. It only takes about a minute and I'm happy to guide you through the whole thing."

*[Back to narrator]*

**Narrator**: "Make it personal ('help me personally'), acknowledge their hesitation, and offer to make it easy. Most will say yes."

**[1:25 - 2:00] OBJECTION 3: "I'M TOO BUSY RIGHT NOW"**

*[Quick role-play]*

**Customer**: "I'm really in a rush right now..."

**Service Rep**: "I totally understand—this will only take about 60 seconds. How about I pull it up while we walk to your car?"

*[If customer still declines]*

**Service Rep**: "No problem at all! Here's a card with the QR code for when you have a free moment."

*[Back to narrator]*

**Narrator**: "Try once to overcome with 'it's only 60 seconds,' but if they push back, respect their time and provide the card."

**[2:00 - 2:35] OBJECTION 4: "CAN I REVIEW YOU ON FACEBOOK INSTEAD?"**

*[Quick role-play]*

**Customer**: "I'm more active on Facebook—can I review you there?"

**Service Rep**: "We definitely appreciate that! Google is actually the most helpful for our business since that's where most people search for services like ours. But any review you're comfortable with is appreciated!"

*[Back to narrator]*

**Narrator**: "Gently steer toward Google, but don't be pushy. If they insist on Facebook, accept graciously."

**[2:35 - 3:10] SCENARIO: CUSTOMER WANTS TO GIVE 4 STARS**

*[Quick role-play]*

**Customer**: "I mean, you guys were good, but I wouldn't say it was perfect. Maybe 4 stars?"

**Service Rep**: "I appreciate your honesty! We definitely want you to leave whatever rating reflects your true experience. Is there something we could have done differently to make it a 5-star experience?"

*[Back to narrator]*

**Narrator**: "Never argue with a star rating. Instead, use it as feedback. Ask what you could improve. This shows you care about getting better, not just getting 5-star reviews."

**[3:10 - 3:30] CLOSING**

*[Talking head]*

The key to handling objections is:
1. Stay calm and friendly
2. Offer solutions
3. Respect their boundaries
4. Always leave a positive impression

Practice these scenarios with your team in your weekly meetings.

---

### Production Notes:

**Format**: Quick-cut between scenarios (fast-paced)

**On-Screen Text**: Display the objection as a title card before each scenario

---

## Video 5: Building Your Review Culture

**Length**: 3-4 minutes
**Purpose**: Show how to sustain the system long-term
**Format**: Talking head + screen share of tracking tools

---

### SCRIPT

**[0:00 - 0:20] OPENING**

*[Talking head]*

Getting reviews isn't a one-time project—it's a cultural shift. In this video, I'll show you how to build a sustainable review culture that runs on autopilot.

**[0:20 - 1:00] THE WEEKLY REVIEW MEETING**

*[Talking head]*

The cornerstone of your review culture is a weekly 15-minute team meeting. Here's the agenda:

**[On-screen text as you talk through it]**

1. Read 3-5 recent reviews aloud (5 minutes)
2. Update your competitive leaderboard (3 minutes)
3. Share individual team stats (3 minutes)
4. Quick process reminder (2 minutes)
5. Motivation and goal reminder (2 minutes)

Same time, same day, every single week. Friday mornings work well.

**[1:00 - 1:45] THE COMPETITIVE LEADERBOARD**

*[Screen share: Show example Google Sheet]*

Create a simple spreadsheet tracking you versus your top 5 competitors.

*[Show the spreadsheet with columns]*

Track:
- Total reviews
- Average stars
- Last review date
- Reviews per week (approximate)

Update this every week before your team meeting.

*[Show chart/graph visualization]*

What you'll notice is that most competitors don't get weekly reviews. You'll start pulling ahead fast.

**[1:45 - 2:20] RECOGNITION & INCENTIVES**

*[Back to talking head]*

Recognition drives behavior. When you read reviews aloud in your meeting, celebrate when team members are mentioned by name. This is why you ask customers to include names in their reviews.

Consider monthly incentives:
- Gift cards for most reviews
- Team lunches when you hit milestones
- Recognition boards in your office

Keep it fun, not punitive. Celebrate participation, not just the top performer.

**[2:20 - 2:55] ROLE-PLAYING PRACTICE**

*[Show brief clip of team role-playing]*

In your meetings, spend 5 minutes monthly role-playing the ask process. This keeps skills sharp and reduces discomfort, especially for new team members.

Pair people up, practice the 8-step process, give feedback.

**[2:55 - 3:30] TRACKING YOUR RESULTS**

*[Screen share: Show metrics spreadsheet]*

Track these key metrics weekly:
- Total review count
- New reviews this week
- Percentage with media
- Individual team member stats

*[Show example tracking sheet]*

I've included a template for this in your download folder.

**[3:30 - 3:50] CLOSING**

*[Back to talking head]*

Culture is built through consistency. Weekly meetings, regular recognition, visible tracking—these are what make the system sustainable.

After 90 days, this will feel like a natural part of how your company operates.

- Example competitive leaderboard
- Example tracking spreadsheet
- Sample review metrics

**Include in Downloads**:
- Tracking spreadsheet template
- Competitive leaderboard template
- Meeting agenda template

## Video 6: Responding to Reviews the Right Way

**Length**: 2-3 minutes
**Purpose**: Show how to respond to reviews for maximum SEO impact
**Format**: Screen recording + examples

---

### SCRIPT

**[0:00 - 0:15] OPENING**

*[Talking head]*

Responding to reviews is just as important as getting them. Google values engagement, and responses boost your ranking.

**[0:15 - 0:45] THE GOLDEN RULE**

*[Talking head]*

Respond to EVERY review within 24-48 hours. Positive or negative.

And here's the critical part: Never use AI to write your responses. Google can detect automated responses, and they don't carry the same weight.

Be human. Be personal. Be specific.

**[0:45 - 1:30] RESPONDING TO POSITIVE REVIEWS**

*[Screen recording: Show Google review interface]*

Let's look at a positive review:

*[Show example review on screen]*

"Sarah was amazing! She helped us through the entire installation and kept everything clean. Highly recommend!"

Here's how I'd respond:

*[Type response in real-time]*

"Hi [Customer Name],

Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us this wonderful review! We're thrilled that Sarah's attention to detail and communication met your expectations. She'll be so happy to hear your kind words.

We appreciate your business and look forward to serving you again!

Best regards,
[Your Name]"

**[On-screen callouts as you review the response]**

Notice:
- Used the customer's name
- Mentioned Sarah specifically
- Referenced specific details (attention to detail, communication)
- Kept it warm but professional
- Included my name

**[1:30 - 2:15] RESPONDING TO NEGATIVE REVIEWS**

*[Screen recording continues]*

Now let's look at a negative review:

*[Show example negative review]*

"Installation was fine but scheduling was a nightmare. Took 3 weeks longer than promised."

Here's the response:

*[Type response]*

"Hi [Customer Name],

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I'm sorry that our scheduling delays didn't meet your expectations—this isn't the experience we want for our customers.

I'd love to discuss this with you directly to understand what went wrong and see how we can make it right. Please contact me at [phone] or [email] at your convenience.

We appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to improve.

[Your Name]"

**[On-screen callouts]**

Notice:
- Acknowledged the specific issue
- Apologized without making excuses
- Offered to make it right
- Took it offline (provided direct contact)
- Professional, not defensive

**[2:15 - 2:40] RESPONSE FREQUENCY & TIMING**

*[Back to talking head]*

Set up Google Business Profile notifications on your phone so you know immediately when reviews come in.

Assign one person (usually owner or manager) to handle all responses.

Respond within 24-48 hours maximum. Fresh responses signal to Google that you're engaged.

**[2:40 - 2:55] CLOSING**

*[Talking head]*

Your responses are public—potential customers are reading them. They're judging you on how you handle both praise and criticism.

Be authentic, be specific, be timely.

**[2:55 - 3:00] SERIES WRAP-UP**

*[Talking head]*

That completes the GUIDED Review Acquisition training series. You now have everything you need to generate 100+ reviews in the next 90 days.

Refer back to your implementation guide anytime you need a refresher. Here's to your success!
