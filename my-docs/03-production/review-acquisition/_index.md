## Framework Philosophy

This framework is designed around a single core principle:

> **"Reviews are earned in-person, in the moment, with guided completion—not requested later via automation."**

Everything else—the QR codes, the scripts, the culture building—exists to support this central truth. When you understand this, you understand why the framework works when email campaigns and text follow-ups don't.

The social accountability of an in-person ask, combined with the removal of friction (QR code) and guidance (walking them through it), creates completion rates of 70-80% versus 5-10% for delayed follow-ups.

**This difference is everything.**
