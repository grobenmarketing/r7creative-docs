## External vs. Internal Price Mapping

**Why the difference?**

External 3-tier structure simplifies customer decision with most popular options:
- **Social Starter** = Base Tier 2 package
- **4-Minute Dominator** = Tier 4 bundled/adjusted
- **Local Market Leader** = Tier 4 + Both Add-Ons

Internal 5-tier structure provides:
- Granular options for different budgets
- Upsell path from basic (Tier 1) to premium (Tier 5)
- Flexibility in custom packages
- Clear add-on pricing
