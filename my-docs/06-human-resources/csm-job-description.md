## Position Overview

The Customer Service Manager (CSM) is the primary human partner for R7 Creative clients, responsible for driving collaboration, proving results, and building momentum throughout the entire client lifecycle. This is not a traditional customer service role—it is a **results-focused partnership role** where you act as the lead operator of each client's "results engine."

### The RaaS Philosophy

R7 Creative is a **Results as a Service (RaaS)** partner, not a software vendor. Our clients hire us for specific, measurable outcomes. Our process—a marriage of cutting-edge software, automation, and expert humans-in-the-loop—is the engine that builds and delivers those results.

**As a CSM, you are the human in the loop.**

## Core Mission

Your mission is threefold:

1. **Drive Collaboration:** Proactively get client inputs (feedback, approvals, assets) needed to keep the engine running without friction
2. **Prove the Result:** Clearly and consistently demonstrate the tangible ROI our engine is producing
